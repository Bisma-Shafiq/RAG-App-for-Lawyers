Often, a representation will raise multiple ethical \\nissues, and as it unfolds over time, additional, perhaps unexpected, \\nconcerns may surface. These issues may be easy to spot or difficult to \\nspot; they may be independent of each other, but they may interact. \\nFacts are often messy and hard to interpret. \\nBy its nature, our textbook treats particular ethical issues in their \\nown chapters—on confidentiality, on conflicts of interest, on client-\\nlawyer relationships, and so forth. A complex multi-issue case study \\nmay straddle several chapters, and for that reason we have assembled \\nthese extended case studies separately from the main text.  \\nThe four case studies presented here are all drawn from actual \\nevents. Each presents multiple ethical issues. Case 1 is a 1982 case, \\nreproduced here with permission of its original authors. The other case \\nstudies are written by the authors of this textbook, and are drawn from \\nrecent high profile cases. In each, we provide extended factual \\nbackground and questions for thought and discussion. \\nAt the beginning of each case study, we provide a brief list of the \\nethics themes that the case raises. This will help instructors decide \\nwhere each case belongs in their syllabus, and it will help students spot \\nthe issues as they read the case study. These lists make it easy to cue \\nthe case studies to the appropriate chapters of the textbook, as we do in \\nthis Preface. Some of the cases appear in the textbook itself, in much-\\nabbreviated form. \\nWe do not expect that instructors will wish to use all four case \\nstudies; each takes at least half a classroom hour to discuss properly. At \\nthe same time, we think they enhance learning, and using one or more \\nof them in the semester will diversify the course, and hopefully make it \\nmore interesting. We believe that the best way to use these case studies \\nis to divide students into small groups to work through their approach \\nto the cases together, either in advance of class or during class. \\nThe four case studies are as follows: \\nCase Study 1 (Rita’s Case), appeared in the textbook in earlier \\neditions. It involves legal aid lawyers in Philadelphia whose client is a \\ngrandmother raising her somewhat troubled granddaughter “Rita,” as \\nsocial services try to place Rita with foster parents. It raises issues about \\nthe lawyers’ appropriate role and style of lawyering, and thus it pairs \\nwith themes in Chapter 4. But it also contains difficult issues of client-\\n1'),\n",

This included \\nreporters for the New York Times, which Boies’s firm was representing \\nin unrelated matters. The espionage firm used “pretexting” \\n(impersonation) as a technique for engaging with reporters. After the \\nWeinstein scandal and the beginnings of the #MeToo movement, Boies \\nmade public comments critical of his client. The case raises questions \\nabout choice of clients (Chapter 4), client loyalty and allocation of \\ndecision-making (Chapter 5), the no-contact rule and attorney-client \\nprivilege (Chapter 6), conflicts of interest and advance waivers of \\nconflicts (Chapter 9), the duties of supervisory lawyers (Chapter 11), and \\nissues of honesty and deceit. \\nCase Study 3 (ACLU Counsel Representing an Undocumented \\nMinor Seeking an Abortion)  is based on the facts underlying the \\nSupreme Court’s 2018 case Azar v. Garza . Here, the Solicitor General \\nasked the Supreme Court to impose disciplinary sanctions against \\nACLU counsel for allegedly deceiving the government in a dramatic and \\ncontentious case involving an undocumented minor seeking an abortion. \\nHer counsel did not inform DOJ lawyers that their client would receive \\nan abortion sooner than the two sides originally anticipated; as a result, \\nthe government failed to file a timely motion for a stay. The SG claimed \\nthat this conduct constituted fraud by omission. However, the Supreme \\nCourt chose to duck the issue. The case study is document-based: it \\nincludes excerpts from the dueling briefs, along with relevant legal \\nstandards, and it asks readers to address the issue the Court failed to \\nresolve. Here, the principal question is whether, in highly contentious \\nlitigation, true but incomplete statements to the adversary constitute \\nfraud by omission. This requires analyzing Model Rule 4.1, but it also \\nraises issues of confidentiality and its exceptions (Chapter 6). On the \\nother side, the study raises the question of whether government lawyers \\nwere drawing out the litigation process until it was too late for the \\nabortion, and whether, if it is true, this is proper. \\nCase Study 4 (Guantánamo Defense Counsel) concerns efforts by \\ndeath penalty lawyers in the Guantánamo military commissions to \\nwithdraw from their case, without judicial approval, because they \\nbelieved the government was listening in on privileged and confidential \\nconversations (Chapter 6). A second issue is whether, after the judge \\nthreatened to arrest them if they did not return to the job, they were \\n2'),\n",

It was April 14, 1982, and the case \\nhad been opened over three years ago, in March, 1979. It had been a long \\nand drawn out process, but the closing letter would indicate that Joan \\nKiladis and Keith Maynard, the two Philadelphia Legal Aid attorneys \\nwho had worked on the case, had obtained their objective—Gladys A. \\nhad been able to adopt her granddaughter over the initial objection of \\nthe Department of Public Welfare. Nonetheless, Kiladis wondered if \\nthere was another issue that should be pursued before this case was put \\nto rest. That issue was the allegation of sexual abuse which had \\nprecipitated Rita’s custody dispute. Although Kiladis was convinced \\nthat the alleged sex abuse suffered by the child had been real, she was \\nless sure whether or not the matter should be pursued. She decided to \\ndiscuss it with Maynard, a poverty lawyer of many years’ experience. \\nKiladis herself, although 40 years old and experienced as a draft \\ncounselor and mother of two, was just two years out of law school—more \\nrecently than the origin of the case itself—and had never encountered \\nan issue as complex as this one. \\nAt Maynard’s office, Kiladis broached the problem with him. It \\nwas not the first time. In fact, Kiladis and Maynard had had a running \\nargument for over a year about whether or not to sue the Children’s \\nHome, in which Rita had resided for many years, for sexual abuse. \\nKiladis went in to argue her position one more time. As she had known \\nhe would, Maynard refused to turn to the specifics of the allegation until \\nhe had reminded both of them of the way the whole system worked when \\nthe custody of a child was at stake. \\n“No one in the system wants to take responsibility for the final \\ndecision about the placement of a child, so there is always a shifting of \\nthat responsibility, and in the final analysis there is no independent \\nadjudication on any issue,” said Maynard. He had learned, over the \\nyears, to use that aspect of the system to his clients’ advantage. In \\nessence, Maynard believed that attorneys created the history of a case \\n \\n* This case was prepared by Leila R.

They manipulated \\nthe other professionals (such as social workers and physicians) involved \\nin the case, and utilized their strengths and weaknesses to the client’s \\nadvantage. Often, whether knowingly or unknowingly, they steered \\nclients’ choices to take advantage of these very efforts. Maynard \\nreminded Kiladis that she had come into the case one and one half years \\nafter he did and was therefore reacting in part to the scenario that he \\nhad created in the file and in the case. Additionally, he pointed out, \\nKiladis had become very personally involved with Gladys, the child, and \\nmany other members of the family. Although this interest had helped to \\nwin the case for Gladys, both of these factors, in Maynard’s opinion, \\naffected Kiladis’s judgment and objectivity. The two attorneys agreed to \\nlook over the files together, one more time, before deciding how to \\nproceed. \\nRita’s Background \\nRita was born in Bellevue Hospital in New York City in December \\nof 1971. Her mother, Carlota, had entered the hospital, in labor, just \\nfour hours after taking a shot of heroin. Rita’s father, who had been \\nliving with Carlota for a number of years and who had fathered her two \\nother children, was not present, nor was his name entered on Rita’s birth \\ncertificate. Carlota abandoned Rita in the hospital, where the infant \\nremained for three months, being treated for both heroin addiction and \\nsyphilis. Her maternal grandmother, Gladys, obtained legal \\nguardianship and took Rita home in March of 1972. \\nRita lived with her grandmother for the next two and one half \\nyears. First they resided in New York City; then, with the New York \\ncourt’s approval, they moved to West Philadelphia where they lived in a \\nhouse next door to a low-income public housing project. Although many \\nmembers of the family—aunts, uncles, cousins—also lived with Gladys \\nat various times during this period, two others were more permanent \\nmembers of the household, both in New York and in Philadelphia. One \\nwas Manuel, Rita’s first cousin. Three years older than Rita, Manuel \\nhad also been born out-of-wedlock, to Rita’s aunt, Maria, and had been \\nraised by Gladys from birth. Maria, like her sister Carlota, was addicted \\nto heroin. The second semi-permanent member of the household, Juan, \\nwas to become Rita’s step-grandfather. Born in 1950, Juan had been \\nbrought up by Gladys since he was 15. He became her third husband in \\n1977, when he was 27 and Gladys was about 51. \\nIn August 1974 Gladys turned to the Department of Public \\nWelfare (DPW) in Philadelphia for help with Rita. The child, although \\nonly two and one half years old, was very difficult to handle; according \\nto Gladys, she had become manipulative, aggressive and generally \\n7'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='unmanageable. Gladys was scheduled for gall bladder surgery and \\nneeded help caring for Rita. The department suggested that Gladys \\nplace Rita in the Catholic Home for Children where the child could be \\nevaluated and receive appropriate therapy, if needed. The Home \\nrequested that St. Christopher’s Hospital evaluate Rita, and then the \\nHome began therapy while Rita resided there. \\nDuring the period from August 1974 until June 1976 Rita seemed \\nto thrive in this placement. She visited her family frequently on \\nweekends, and her grandmother was often at the Home during the week \\nas well. Gladys viewed the Catholic Home as a temporary residential \\nfacility where children could receive help. The DPW, however, often \\nused the Home as a clearinghouse for children needing foster care. In \\nfact, in June 1976 the Home decided to place Rita with a foster family \\nin Germantown, a lower-middle -class Philadelphia suburb. Gladys \\ncontinued to visit Rita and take her home on weekends, during the next \\nseven months that Rita lived in Germantown. Relations between Gladys \\nand Rita’s foster family quickly became strained. The foster parents \\ncomplained to the Home that Gladys was not sticking to the visitation \\nschedule, and Gladys complained to DPW that Rita’s foster parents were \\nabusing her. Acting on these latter reports, DPW removed Rita from the \\nfoster family and returned her to her grandmother. By this time, \\nFebruary 1977, Juan and Gladys had married. \\nFour months later, Gladys turned once again to DPW. Gladys had \\nbeen receiving counseling from a social worker, Elizabeth Reilly, who \\nhad encouraged her to seek help with Rita. Gladys was depressed, and \\nthe child was still aggressive and difficult, biting other children and \\nthrowing temper tantrums. Again DPW placed Rita in the Catholic \\nHome for Children. During the following 18 months, Rita again settled \\ninto the routine at the Home, and again the Home moved toward a foster \\nplacement. Although there were still many home visits, Gladys was \\nhaving more difficulty maintaining the visiting schedule. She often did \\nnot arrive when she had promised to do so, and she often left early. \\nOccasionally, Rita’s mother, who had also moved to Philadelphia, visited \\nher at the Home. Home personnel noted that Rita often returned from \\nvisits to Gladys appearing distressed. \\nThe move toward placing Rita in a foster home was greatly \\naccelerated in January of 1979. For two months, Rita had been in play \\ntherapy with a young psychology student who had become increasingly \\nalarmed by the child’s apparent sexual sophistication. Rita was then \\nseven years of age. The student believed that Rita was acting out, in \\ntherapy, some experience of sexual seduction or observation of sexual \\nbehavior. The student, and her supervisor—who was studying sexually \\nabused children—concurred that Rita had had such experiences and \\n8'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='that they must have occurred in Gladys’s home, or at the least when \\nRita was in Gladys’s care. Suspecting Juan, Rita’s step-grandfather, the \\nHome filed a Form CY47 report of possible abuse with DPW. Rita was \\nthen moved to a foster placement with a middle-class family in \\nJenkintown, a well-to-do distant suburb of Philadelphia about 20 miles \\nfrom Gladys’s home in West Philadelphia. Gladys was given neither \\nRita’s address nor her phone number. \\nGladys turned for help to her social worker, who contacted \\nPhiladelphia Legal Aid (PLA) and asked Maynard to intercede on \\nGladys’s behalf. DPW was about to file a motion for protective custody \\nof Rita and a motion to dispense with Rita’s mother’s consent to Rita’s \\nadoption by the foster family in Jenkintown. It was DPW’s position that \\nGladys, as grandmother, had no standing to intervene. \\nThe legal battle began in the spring of 1979 and resulted, first, in \\nestablishing a pattern of visitation between Rita and Gladys, agreed to \\nby the parties; next, in the return of Rita to live with Gladys in March \\n1981; and finally in the adoption of Rita by Gladys and Juan in April \\n1982. By then Gladys and Juan were living separately. In the interim \\nboth Maynard and Kiladis at PLA had become involved with the case; \\nthe court had appointed an attorney, David Slade, an associate at a \\nsmall downtown law firm, to represent Rita; there had been a complete \\nchange in DPW personnel dealing with the case and with the family; \\nand St. Christopher’s had done two court-ordered psychological \\nevaluations of Rita and her grandparents, to be paid for by the county. \\nLawyers’ Views \\nLooking back over their files on Rita, Maynard and Kiladis noted \\nthe legal issues that had punctuated the child’s short but complex life. \\nThere had been prolonged guardianship hearings while Rita was still a \\npatient in the Bellevue nursery in New York, which had continued after \\nRita went to live with Gladys. Kiladis remarked: \\nThe result was, when Carlota—Rita’s mother—\\nrealized that she was going to lose all of her children, she \\nactually got herself on methadone. And, although there \\nwere lapses, she was eventually given her older two \\nchildren back, with enormous supervision. She had also \\ncome to Pennsylvania. I’m not sure whether legally or not. \\nBut she seemed to be doing a reasonably good job with the \\nolder children. \\nIt was not clear why Gladys had been named guardian, since \\ngrandparents had no special status in guardianship cases, and certain \\nfactors in Gladys’s home life seemed to argue against court-ordered \\n9'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='guardianship. Maynard guessed that some social worker had filed the \\nnecessary papers and pushed the guardianship through. \\nWhen Gladys contacted DPW in August 1974, her feelings toward \\nRita seemed to Maynard to indicate ambivalence, “Gladys loves Rita, \\nalso can’t control her, is somewhat older and not feeling well. There is \\nthis, ‘I want her away, I want her back.’  ” As soon as her surgery was \\nscheduled, she sought help in coping with the child. Maynard observed: \\nThe puzzle here is why, between ’74 and ’76, Gladys, \\nwhen she finished her gall bladder operation, did not bring \\nRita home. I think this is where the ambivalence \\nmanifests. That is, once Gladys got home, and a period of \\ntime passed as she recovered from major surgery, she \\nfound she had a situation that was not so bad. So Gladys \\nleft things alone; in the same way, I think, that some \\nparents in other class settings who are ambivalent about \\ntheir children, have their children in boarding school. \\nBut Gladys couldn’t adapt to the “boarding school” regime; she \\ncouldn’t adapt to the rules. “I think the Home found Gladys to be a pain \\nin the ass,” added Maynard. She couldn’t do anything on time. She came \\nto visit Rita during the week, she baked birthday cakes for other \\nchildren’s birthdays and came with those. She often brought Rita back \\nlate after a weekend home visit. Sometimes after such visits Rita’s face \\nand clothes were dirty and her hair uncombed, which shocked Home \\npersonnel. The Home staff, accordingly, decided that Rita would be \\nbetter off in foster care and placed her in Germantown. This decision \\nwas reinforced by the fact that they didn’t get a clear statement from \\nGladys that she wanted Rita back before they placed her. Afterwards, \\nhowever, Glady’s interest in Rita’s return increased enormously. \\nMaynard mused: \\nI believe that Gladys intentionally undermined this \\nplacement. She was extremely threatened that she had \\nfailed as a mother again, and that she was going to lose \\nRita permanently. Gladys did not have the ability to \\ndirectly say to the Home, “I want my child back.” So, I think \\nshe made it very difficult for the foster family. When she \\ntalked to Rita about it, Rita picked up signals about what \\nGladys wanted to hear. So Rita started saying things about \\nwhat was being done to her. You couldn’t really tell \\nwhether they were true or not. \\nKiladis, however, was more convinced of the truth of Rita’s \\ncomplaints. She recalled that Rita related to her, almost four years after \\nthat first placement, an incident in which the foster father had given \\n10'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='her a severe beating for not doing a dance of some kind. Gladys had \\ncorroborated this tale with a description of bruises on Rita’s buttocks, \\nback and sides. It was at that time that Gladys finally complained to the \\nDPW social worker, and he had Rita returned to Gladys within three \\ndays. Kiladis added, “I suspect that that really is the fastest the DPW \\nworks.” \\nThe PLA lawyers recalled that, at first, everything seemed fine \\nwhen Rita returned to Gladys. But soon it became clear that Rita was \\nstill a very difficult child. Gladys became very depressed. She couldn’t \\nhandle Rita at all, and something seemed to be wrong with the child. \\nGladys turned to a social worker therapist, Elizabeth Reilly, and had \\nRita evaluated at the Learning Disabilities Center where Reilly worked. \\nReilly not only convinced Gladys to place Rita back at the Home, but she \\nalso began a process of convincing Gladys to put Rita up for adoption. \\nAccording to Maynard: \\nIt was not very long into therapy that Elizabeth \\nReilly said to herself, “This is a woman with extreme \\nemotional problems, not sick, but with emotional problems; \\nand she has a very complicated relationship with a young \\nman. She is having some trouble raising one child—\\nManuel; she is having a lot of difficulty with Rita, who \\nseems to be a disturbed child. Gladys can’t cope. This is not \\ngood for Rita, this is not good for Gladys, so let’s move for \\nadoption.” \\nBut Reilly was not totally open with Gladys, who seemed to \\nbelieve that Rita’s placement in the Home was again temporary; that \\nthe Home would provide treatment for Rita; that she would visit often \\nand bring Rita home on weekends; and, eventually, perhaps when Rita \\nimproved, would bring her home again. \\nMaynard recalled that now Gladys’s visits took on a different kind \\nof irregularity. Gladys would say that she was coming on Sunday and \\nthen show up on Monday; she would say “I’m coming at noon” and then \\nshow up at 6:00 P.M. During Rita’s first stay at the Home, Gladys had \\nbeen late in bringing her back; now she was often late picking her up. \\nThe records from the Home’s logs indicated that Rita often returned to \\nthe Home upset and even had difficulty sleeping on some occasions after \\na home visit. Kiladis felt that Rita was being torn between her life with \\nGladys and her life at the Home. Many of the rules were different, and \\nshe speculated that Rita must have struggled with Gladys’s disapproval \\nof many of the practices at the Home. An example, recalled by Kiladis, \\nwas Gladys’s anger and concern that Rita was permitted to sleep in a \\nnightgown without panties, and to sleep in the same room as the boys \\nin her cottage. At the same time, a nun at the Home had expressed \\n11'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='concern that Rita was allowed to get into bed with Gladys to watch \\ntelevision. \\nWithin a year of Rita’s return to the Home, plans were again \\nmade to move Rita to a foster family. Maynard remarked: \\nThe planning came from the judgments of the people \\nat the Home that Rita really ought to be permanently  \\nplaced somewhere, and that Grandma should remain \\nGrandma. There should be visits, but Rita should slowly be \\nweaned away from her Grandmother. This was a judgment \\nthat was concurred in by Elizabeth Reilly, Gladys’s \\ntherapist. And there was something in writing, some \\ndocument from the Home that indicated consent by Gladys \\nto an adoption. Interestingly enough, when we got \\ndiscovery that document was missing; but I had seen it. \\nBut the plans to move Rita into a foster placement were greatly \\naccelerated when the young, inexperienced psychology student, after six \\nplay-therapy sessions with Rita, concluded that Rita had been sexually \\nabused. Kiladis commented: \\nThe student was being supervised by someone whose \\n“thing” was sexual abuse. What wasn’t so clear to us and \\ntook us a while to find out was that half of the children in \\nthe Home had been placed there as a result of being \\nsexually abused. This student felt that Rita was acting out \\nvarious sexual behaviors. What was somewhat unfair \\nabout it, was that—apparently—this went on all the time. \\nKids, often, playacted partly as a way of working through \\nsome of what they’ve been through, and obviously it rubbed \\noff on some of the other kids. But this student really \\nfreaked out about what was going on. \\nAlthough it was quite possible that Rita had been exposed to some \\nsexual behavior, it was not clear exactly what had occurred or where. \\nThe Home immediately directed suspicion at Juan and decided to place \\nRita out of Gladys’s reach. Although formally the reason for cutting off \\nvisitation was the sexual abuse question, Maynard believed that what \\nwas lurking in the background was Gladys’s failure to cooperate with \\nthe first foster placement. “All of the social workers’ notes were loaded \\nwith things like that, that Gladys was and had continuously been \\ndifficult.” \\nThe Home’s inappropriate promise to Rita’s new foster parents in \\nJenkintown, the Biancos, that the child was definitely theirs to adopt \\ncomplicated matters further. Kiladis felt that this promise might have \\nbeen part of “a deliberate cover-up” of Rita’s exposure to either sexual \\n12'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='abuse or sexual activity at the Home itself. At first Gladys had reacted \\npassively to Rita’s placement in a foster home, as she had when Rita was \\nplaced in Germantown the first time. But when the new DPW worker \\non the case, Mary Nota, who had met Gladys only once before, bluntly \\ntold her that Rita was being placed a second time, adding “I’m not going \\nto let you see her,” and furthermore made accusations about sexual \\nabuse of Rita by Juan, Gladys’s attitude suddenly altered. Maynard \\nrecalled: “Gladys went back to Reilly and her staff and drove them crazy, \\nscreaming at them, ‘You’ve got to help me!’ and they in turn called us.” \\nMaynard added: \\nI got a call from them saying that we had to help this \\nwoman. There had been accusations of sexual abuse and \\nher child had been taken away. They didn’t say anything \\nto me about the fact that they had been moving Gladys \\ntoward adoption, that they themselves felt that that might \\nbe both in Gladys and Rita’s best interests. I learned of \\nthese things only after the case came to us. \\nIn a complicated series of moves (see legal strategy below) \\nMaynard was able to negotiate a visitation schedule while Rita was \\nbeing evaluated by a group of specialists at St. Christopher’s, who dealt \\nwith child and sex abuse victims. After several weeks, however, the \\n“games began again,” as Kiladis put it. She commented that Gladys and \\nthe Biancos competed for Rita like divorcing parents. Gladys was never \\non time bringing back Rita and never returned her to the Biancos in the \\nsame clothes in which she had left. The Biancos often dressed her \\ninappropriately—for example, dressing her in a party dress when they \\nknew that Gladys was taking Rita on a picnic. The Biancos would then \\ncomplain when Rita’s dress became soiled. Each family criticized the \\nother’s way of life. The Biancos were not Hispanic, and Jenkintown had \\nessentially no Hispanic population. Rita, who had been bilingual, could \\nno longer speak much Spanish. In fact, the Biancos severely \\nreprimanded her for any tendencies to use Spanish. At school in \\nJenkintown she was exposed to racial slurs and made to feel very \\ninferior for being Spanish. Kiladis recalled that Rita had told her that \\nthe Biancos said, “If you go back to West Philadelphia you will become \\nscum like the rest of them, but we have this wonderful suburban \\nlifestyle.” The attorneys began to believe that the situation in \\nJenkintown was so bad that returning Rita to Gladys seemed to be a \\nrelatively better course. They were concerned that Rita was losing her \\nidentity as an Hispanic, and that if Rita were not returned to the \\nHispanic community, her ethnic roots would be irreversibly lost. \\nBy the time Kiladis entered the case, Maynard had gotten to know \\nGladys well. He didn’t believe for one minute that there was sexual \\n13'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='abuse in Gladys’s home. He also believed that losing Rita permanently \\nwould be a terrible blow for her. If, during the course of the prolonged \\nlegal maneuverings, Gladys’s anger and anxiety had dissipated and she \\nhad become able once again to consider adoption as in Rita’s best \\ninterests, Maynard would have been amenable. But by the time he had \\nobtained all the information he needed to represent Gladys, the \\nsituation had been reshaped by the judicial process itself. \\nHe had begun his interviewing of the various professionals \\ninvolved knowing that by the time there was a decision about what \\nmight be best for Rita, that decision might not look the same as it would \\nhave on the day he began. Appraising his feelings at the time, Maynard \\ncommented: \\nInvariably I begin investigating these sorts of cases \\nas if the facts are there to be assembled for decision at some \\nfuture date. But, on the ground that then we will make a \\ndecision, in my gut, I know that the decision is not going to \\nbe the same once the investigation is completed. Memories, \\nperceptions and positions will all have been affected, \\ninfluenced by the investigation itself. What might have \\nlooked very bad for a client before a lawyer gets into a case \\ncan look very different after the lawyer’s influence is felt. \\nOn the other hand, what are the choices? This is not an \\nextreme case where I suspected that the child was being \\nabused by my client. I did suspect, and this turned out to \\nbe true, that Rita’s mother was involved much more than \\nGladys was telling us. Rita had Carlota’s phone number \\nand often spoke with her, and Carlota was often at Gladys’s \\nhouse. In addition, Rita went over to her mother’s house \\nmore often than any of us had realized, and the exposures \\nover there that would be bad for a child were enormous. \\nBut this wasn’t enough to alter what I did in the case. I \\nsimply chose the right of Gladys to make the decision about \\nher grandchild, over other people. I did not decide that I \\nwas the lawyer to the whole situation to decide what was \\nbest for Rita. Within certain limits, I really did and do allow \\nmy role as an advocate in the situation to take its course. \\nKiladis’ approach to this was somewhat different. Kiladis had let \\nMaynard know, when she first became involved with the case, that she \\nhad to speak with Rita before she made a commitment to represent \\nGladys. If DPW were correct in its evaluation of the situation and if Rita \\nhad developed a strong positive bond with the Biancos, then Kiladis felt \\nshe would not have “the emotional energy for the case.” But if Rita \\nreported that life with the Biancos was very different from the way both \\n14'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='the Home and DPW described it, then “it would be very important to \\nhelp her.” Kiladis recalled: \\nUltimately, it put me in a bit of a bind. It wasn’t clear \\nwhose attorney I was; what I was advocating for, and so on. \\nKnowing Rita’s needs as well as Gladys’s and eventually \\neven Carlota’s created a lot of tension for me. Their needs \\nwere different and it was not clear how to bargain them \\nout; whether to try to get the maximum good for everyone \\nor just for our client, Gladys. \\nAside from the question of what might or might not be in Rita’s \\nbest interests, Maynard had first been confronted with the problem of \\nGladys’s best interests. For Maynard, that issue had two distinct parts. \\nFirst, Gladys wanted Maynard to move immediately to get Rita back for \\nher. Here Maynard had two concerns: first, that he might lose in court \\nif he had to go in at a time when suspicions of sexual abuse were being \\nraised, and, second, that a court battle would take its toll on Gladys \\nherself. At the outset Gladys was not emotionally capable of \\nwithstanding the upheaval of a prolonged court procedure. Early in the \\ncase Maynard had come to realize that it would be extremely painful for \\nGladys to confront an outside observer’s evaluation of her fitness for \\nparenthood. \\nGladys’s one emotional peg was her therapist, Reilly. It was Reilly \\nwho had called Maynard and implored him to represent Gladys against \\nDPW. Yet it was also Reilly who believed that Rita should be adopted; if \\nDPW called her at trial, she would make a damning expert witness \\nagainst Gladys. In fact, at the beginning there had been no expert \\nwitnesses available who could make a favorable presentation. Maynard \\nbelieved that Reilly had, as he put it, “screwed Gladys” by not being \\nhonest with her about the therapist’s concerns, both that Rita was being \\nexposed to a drug-dominated environment through continued contacts \\nwith Carlota and that Gladys was too depressed to cope with the \\nsituation. He had insisted, after speaking with Reilly, that she become \\nmore honest with Gladys and that he was not going to be the one to go \\nback and tell Gladys what the therapist’s position actually was. \\nMaynard felt obligated both to tell his clients everything he \\ndiscovered and at the same time to protect them. Although he intended \\nto be Gladys’s advocate and try to intervene with DPW, his legal \\ninstincts told him he could best manage the case by drawing things out \\nfor quite a while despite Gladys’s desire to act immediately. Maynard \\ntherefore decided that it did not make sense to force the issue to a \\nhearing right away: \\n15'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='One, I couldn’t win. Two, I thought this would be bad \\nfor Gladys. And three, the expert who had been doing \\ntherapy all of this time could not make a good witness for \\nGladys. So I went back to Gladys and I said: “I don’t think \\nthat I can win it now. I don’t think I can even get you \\nvisitation now, although if you tell me that I have to, I will \\ntry. I also don’t think that Elizabeth Reilly will be as good \\na witness for you as she needs to be. I have got to do a lot \\nof work with her, and you should start talking to her as \\nwell.” . . . Of course she accepted it, the way she accepts all \\nauthorities, in a passive/aggressive manner. But I \\nconfronted her with that also. We talked about her anger \\nwith me and her inability to challenge me. I think we did \\nso in a healthy way, but long after the initial decision to \\nwait had been made. \\nLegal Strategy \\nThe first official action taken by Maynard as Gladys’s lawyer was \\na letter which he wrote for her on May 10, 1979, more than two months \\nafter she came to him. Essentially the letter was a statement from \\nGladys that she wished to terminate DPW’s custody of Rita, and it \\nincluded a demand that Rita be returned to her. Maynard knew that \\nthis would precipitate action on the part of the department, and it did. \\nBut by then Maynard had begun the process he described as “obtaining \\ninformation from, and trying to neutralize,” the professionals involved \\nin the case, and he was ready to proceed. In the March through May \\nperiod, Maynard had constantly asked for visits at critical times: a \\nconfirmation ceremony in the family, illness of a close relative, a whole \\nrange of similar events. Each time, the visits were refused. There was \\nconstant negotiation with DPW about visits. The Department’s hard-\\nline position was later brought up by Maynard in conversations with St. \\nChristopher’s and with David Slade, whom the court had appointed as \\nRita’s attorney on June 11, 1979. In addition, the staff at PLA had begun \\nto see every person involved in the case. The legal docket in Philadelphia \\nCounty Probate Court indicates that the DPW moved for temporary \\ncustody of Rita on May 25, 1979, and that that motion was allowed by \\nJudge Warren. \\nOn June 8, 1979, Maynard filed two motions: one for visitation \\nand one for the payment of expert assistance for a psychological \\nevaluation. When they went into court on the 11th of June, Maynard did \\nnot press the first motion. Instead he again negotiated with DPW about \\nthe visitation issue: \\nWhat I said to them was that Gladys should be \\nallowed to visit. I asked them why they felt that she \\n16'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='shouldn’t. They told me that it was too dangerous, that \\nGladys, or someone in her household, was going to sexually \\nabuse the child. Then I brought up the notion of having an \\nindependent expert decide the issue. I used the two \\nmotions to get them to concede to the motion for expert \\nassistance. \\nIn fact, the visitation motion was never acted on in court; \\nMaynard continued to pursue that goal through negotiation. On the \\nother hand, Judge Warren allowed the motion for payment of expert \\nassistance, given that DPW did not oppose it. Had the department \\nopposed it at that time, Maynard believed that he still might have been \\nable to prevail, but he couldn’t be sure, given the costs it imposed on the \\ncounty. Instead, everybody agreed that expert assistance was a good \\nidea; that Gladys really couldn’t afford it, that it should be provided and, \\nmoreover, that it should be provided by the team of specialists at St. \\nChristopher’s. Maynard’s choice of that team was a deliberate one: \\nBefore I went on the motion, I went to St. \\nChristopher’s. I had two meetings with the people there. \\nThey had never seen Gladys, but I had two meetings with \\nthem. I had a long talk with them about what I saw was \\ngoing on and about how important it was that they look \\ninto it. I also went to see the fellow who runs the clinic, \\nknowing that at that time St. Christopher’s was involved \\nin an internal struggle over whether to support DPW’s \\napproach to child custody issues, an approach which many \\nsaw as extreme intervention. \\nMaynard felt that many of the specialists on the team at St. \\nChristopher’s had attitudes that were ideal for his client. They were \\ninternally involved in a fight about whether they should be supportive \\nof DPW’s approach to removing children from their homes; they were \\nsympathetic to poor people; they didn’t respect social workers (who \\ngenerally stood at the bottom of the hierarchy of mental health \\nprofessionals); and they believed that the social workers’ decisions were \\noften ill-advised and unsympathetic to poor people. Maynard recalled, “I \\nknew they would bend over backwards to be non-interventionist in a \\ncase with PLA; I knew they would take the general position that these \\nkids belong at home.” In this particular case, where a child was being \\ntaken from an Hispanic environment and being removed to a distant \\nsuburb where she was not being allowed to see her relatives, Maynard \\nthought the team would surely begin with an attitude biased in favor of \\nGladys. By the time Maynard had met with them twice, he knew that \\nhe had a “fairly receptive audience.” \\n17'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='Maynard told Judge Warren that he had been to see the people at \\nSt. Christopher’s, and had talked with them. He indicated that they \\nwould be willing to accept the appointment from the court. Maynard was \\nrelieved that neither Slade nor the DPW counsel objected to the choice \\nof St. Christopher’s as evaluator. Had he been on the other side, \\nMaynard noted, he would have demanded a different appointment, \\nrecognizing that the attorney who got to the expert first established a \\nrelationship which invariably sets up the case to some extent in his \\nfavor. But, in Maynard’s words, “They were so relieved to give up this \\nfight on visitation for a period of time that they went along with the \\nappointment of St. Christopher’s as an evaluator.” \\nIt was not until August of 1980 that Slade voiced some concern \\nabout the evaluation being done by St. Christopher’s. At that time he \\nmoved for an additional psychological evaluation and payment of costs. \\nAlthough this evaluation was also to be conducted by St. Christopher’s, \\nSlade specified that the report evaluate Gladys’s household as a \\npotential home for Rita rather than limiting itself to the question of \\nwhether or not abuse had occurred there. Although Maynard knew that \\nSlade might have realized that the St. Christopher’s team was going \\nover to Gladys’s side, Maynard went along with the motion for a new \\nevaluation because “I knew we had St. Christopher’s; once you’ve got \\nthem that far, you’ve got them.” \\nThe entire evaluation process was very drawn out. But that also, \\nMaynard thought, worked in Gladys’s favor in the long run. In the \\ninterim, the PLA attorneys were able to build up visitation, bit by bit; \\nthey saw Rita’s therapist in Jenkintown, the nun at the Home, the DPW \\nsocial workers, and Gladys’s therapist, Reilly. Every interview had a \\ndual purpose: it was an opportunity to get information and an \\nopportunity to in some way “neutralize” the speaker to ensure his or her \\npassive acquiescence in (if not active support for) a result which favored \\nGladys. Maynard commented that “all of those contacts were \\nnegotiations as well as interviews. The whole strategy was to bring the \\nprofessionals around so that they saw Rita’s placement as something \\nthat ought to change.” \\nMaynard knew that Gladys’s standing to intervene with DPW’s \\nattempts to gain custody of Rita might be c hallenged. Grandparents, \\nunlike parents, had no special status in custody cases, and Maynard was \\nconcerned about the legality in Pennsylvania of a guardianship \\nauthorized by New York. He had asked students and others at PLA to \\nresearch the issue, but there seemed to be no law on it. Maynard treated \\nGladys as if she were a substitute mother, but he knew that that status \\nwas not clear legally. By the end of the case, the DPW counsel and \\neveryone else involved was referring to Gladys as Rita’s legal guardian, \\n18'),\n",

In February \\n1981, PLA filed the New York guardianship records, but Kiladis \\nrecalled, “I was reluctant to bring up the issue of Gladys’s guardianship \\nfrom New York because I had researched that and I knew how flimsy it \\nwas.” \\nAccording to Maynard, the DPW social worker on the case when \\nRita was first placed with the Biancos, Mary Nota, had not only bungled \\nrelations with Gladys when the move was made, but also had difficulty \\nmanaging an adversarial relationship with PLA. He recalled he was able \\nto take advantage of Nota’s mistakes: “We worked on Mary Nota to the \\npoint where she was so angry with us that she made a terrible witness \\nat St. Christopher’s. All she did was rant and rave about us and not talk \\nabout Rita.” Maynard deliberately did nothing to decrease Nota’s \\nvindictiveness nor to improve her relationship with Gladys. Kiladis had \\nalso seriously questioned Nota’s choice of Betty Bianco as a foster \\nmother. Betty was known as someone who became very attached to the \\nchildren placed with her, and then was very upset when any one of them \\nleft. This bonding, in Kiladis’s opinion, was certain to exacerbate the \\nrelationship between Betty and Gladys. Both women were fighting to be \\nRita’s mother. \\nDuring this period, there were many personnel shifts at DPW; \\namong them, the replacement of Mary Nota by Margaret Kamin. Kiladis \\nand Maynard both perceived this change to be a very beneficial one for \\ntheir client. People from PLA were in Kamin’s office within a week after \\nshe started, talking to her about the situation from their point of view. \\nMaynard recalled that Kamin wasn’t completely taken in by this \\nstrategy, but she was willing to give the case a fresh look. \\nA great deal had changed under the influence of PLA. A schedule \\nof day visits had been established. The St. Christopher’s team was \\nevaluating the situation, and though Gladys was cooperating fully with \\nthem, Betty Bianco was not. Because Betty refused to bring Rita in to \\nPhiladelphia to go to St. Christopher’s, Joan Kiladis and then Margaret \\nKamin, were driving out to Jenkintown to pick up Rita and bring her \\ndowntown. Gladys was still in therapy with Elizabeth Reilly, whom \\nMaynard felt he had “turned around.” \\nThe team at St. Christopher’s was aware that Rita was feeling a \\ngreat deal of tension because of the racism in the Jenkintown school she \\nwas attending. By March 1980 a talk between Gladys’s attorneys and \\nthe staff at St. Christopher’s indicated that they were coming to three \\nconclusions, summarized in a memo in the PLA file: \\n(1) While the St. Christopher’s team cannot state \\ncategorically that there has been no sexual abuse, nothing \\n19'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='in Rita’s language or behavior indicates any basis for the \\nCY47. If she was abused, she is no longer cognizant of the \\nfact. The team believes that the filing of the CY47 was ill-\\nadvised; that a lot of the behavior cited is characteristic of \\ninstitutional living. (2) Rita wants to go home to her \\ngrandmother, cannot understand why she is moved from \\nplace to place and is apprehensive that her therapists will \\nbe taken away from her. (3) Because of the above, the team \\nwould recommend that Rita be returned to Gladys’s home \\nand continue in therapy at St. Christopher’s. \\nKiladis remembered that St. Christopher’s was unwilling \\nofficially to exonerate Juan of sexual abuse; nor would the evaluators \\naddress the possibility that Rita was being beaten by the Biancos. Rita \\nhad written a letter to her therapist at St. Christopher’s, saying that she \\nwas being beaten and generally mistreated by the Biancos and that she \\nwanted to go home to her grandmother and “pappy,” her name for Juan. \\nAlthough Kiladis had not actually handed Rita the pencil and paper to \\nwrite it, she felt somewhat implicated in the letter-writing process \\nbecause she frequently urged Rita to be frank with the people at St. \\nChristopher’s, reassuring her that what she told her therapist there \\nwould not get back to the Biancos. \\nKiladis had also told Rita to be frank with David Slade, but as it \\nhad turned out, Rita never got to talk with Slade. Although he was the \\nchild’s attorney, and according to Maynard had left “no legal stone \\nunturned,” he never went out to see the child or asked to have her \\nbrought to his office. Maynard recalled, “We did not sit down with Slade \\nand say, ‘you should see the kid.’ If we had, I think that he would have \\ngone. But we didn’t do that.” \\nAssessing Slade’s representation, Maynard observed there were \\ntwo dimensions to cases like Rita’s. First, there was the purely legal \\nobligation to pursue certain issues and employ certain procedural \\ntactics. Maynard thought that Slade clearly understood his legal \\nobligations and met them by moving for, and then supporting, \\nevaluation of Rita’s situation by an independent source. He did have a \\nconversation with the team at St. Christopher’s. He did talk with the \\nsocial worker. But he never met Rita: he never dealt with the second \\ndimension, never became involved with his client as a person, never \\ntried to make the legal objective fit the person’s needs. Kiladis said that \\nboth Rita and Gladys had called Slade’s office on numerous occasions \\nand left messages on his answering machine, but their calls were never \\nreturned. Maynard added: \\nSlade lived in another world. He lived in the \\ndowntown world of big firms; those attorneys don’t go to \\n20'),\n",

It’s not for \\neverybody, but it’s for more people than you’d think if \\nthey’d give it a chance. \\nIt was not clear to Maynard what Slade was advocating. At first \\nhe had gone along with DPW, but later he opposed them as well and \\nasked for continuances. Slade seemed to feel that Rita had already lost \\nher identification as an Hispanic, and that therefore ethnicity was no \\nlonger at issue. Slade was not even present at the final two hearings in \\nthe case. \\nFurther, the PLA attorneys were able to turn Kiladis’s \\ncoincidental friendship with two of the women at DPW who were \\ninvolved with Rita’s case to Gladys’s advantage. Memos in the PLA file \\nindicate that Kiladis had long telephone conversations with Susan \\nGoldman, the supervisory social worker. Goldman had often called \\nKiladis at her home to discuss her worry over Margaret Kamin’s \\nextreme emotional involvement in Rita’s case. They also discussed the \\nCY47, which at that point was two years old and had never been \\nsubstantiated or officially pursued. Goldman felt that the psychology \\nstudent who had made the first report of sexual abuse had been under \\nconsiderable pressure, pressure to find instances of such abuse for her \\nsupervisor’s book. She and Kiladis discussed the question of why the \\nHome had chosen to move Rita into foster placement at a time when \\nmany of the professionals involved were warning against any change. \\nKiladis told Goldman of her own belief that Juan was a stabilizing \\ninfluence on the family, and that his youth counted in the family’s favor \\nif any concerns about Gladys’s failing health might arise. Kiladis \\nreassured Goldman that DPW need not rely upon Kamin’s judgment \\nthat Gladys and Juan were “okay as parents,” since St. Christopher’s \\nwas certainly very competent and would be making a favorable report. \\nSimilarly, Kiladis was continually in contact with Grace Myers, \\nthe counsel for DPW. Before Grace Myers became the attorney of record \\non the case, Kiladis had met her at the Philadelphia County Courthouse. \\nKiladis explained: \\nI had several long conversations with Grace. I knew her \\nfrom law school. When I talked with her at the courthouse, \\nI knew that some of what I was saying would get back to \\nthe department.

Myers, according to Kiladis, “knew that I \\nbelieved in what I was saying, that Rita wanted to go to Gladys; that \\nGladys wanted her, and that there were support mechanisms at work \\nthat I had no objection to.” \\nAccording to Maynard, “it was Joan’s involvement in the case that \\nfinally won it for Gladys.” Kiladis not only spent many hours talking \\nwith Margaret Kamin, Susan Goldman and Grace Myers, she also spent \\na great deal of time with Gladys and Rita. From Jenkintown she drove \\nRita to and from St. Christopher’s and to and from Gladys’s for visits. \\nShe met Carlota and recognized the extensive contact that Rita still had \\nwith her mother. Indeed, Kiladis felt that the entire custody issue might \\nnever have arisen if Carlota had been legally represented from the start. \\nKiladis in many ways became an advisor and counselor to Gladys, \\ntalking with her about the best school placement for Manuel, and \\neventually, Rita, as well as answering Gladys’s questions about various \\npresents for Rita while the child was still living with the Biancos. \\nKiladis recalled, “I had to set limits or I would have been making up \\ngrocery lists for her.” \\nOn January 29, 1981, Kiladis filed a petition for Gladys and Juan \\nto adopt Rita. By then Kiladis herself had been with the case since the \\nfall of 1980 and had gotten to know (or knew previously) all of the \\nprofessionals involved, as well as the “principals”: Rita, Gladys, Betty \\nBianco, and even Carlota and Juan. Since Juan spoke very little English, \\nKiladis’s acquaintance with him was very limited.

Manuel went along at \\nfirst, but since the sessions interfered with his first love, baseball, he \\nsoon asked to be allowed not to attend. This was agreed to by the \\ntherapist at St. Christopher’s. Juan refused to go from the very \\nbeginning. Kiladis believed that his resistance arose from a combination \\nof his remaining distress about having been accused of sexually abusing \\nRita and the traditional “macho” notion that men did not talk about \\ntheir feelings. For whatever reasons, Juan said that if he had to attend \\ntherapy sessions, he was moving out. And shortly thereafter he did so, \\nmoving in with a woman his own age. \\nGladys, Manuel and Rita were now living together at Gladys’s \\nhome in West Philadelphia. Gladys was in therapy with Elizabeth \\nReilly, and Rita and Gladys continued to go to therapists at St. \\nChristopher’s. Margaret Kamin of DPW remained involved. Finally, in \\nFebruary of 1982, Kiladis convinced Susan Goldman that it was time for \\nDPW to release Rita from its custody by moving to dismiss the original \\nDPW motions for custody and to dispense with Carlota’s consent to \\nRita’s adoption. A hearing was set before Judge Yates on February 2. \\nBecause Rita was ill that day, she and Gladys did not attend. Kiladis \\nwas there, along with Grace Myers and Margaret Kamin for DPW; \\nDavid Slade was not present. Since there was no opposition to the \\ndismissal of the two motions filed by DPW, the judge was willing to \\ndismiss them. But, he asked, who would then be Rita’s guardian? Myers \\nmentioned that Gladys was legally Rita’s guardian because of the New \\nYork court order. Kiladis, not convinced of the validity of that order in \\nPennsylvania, told the judge that she had filed an adoption petition for \\nGladys and Juan. Kamin voiced some concern about allowing Rita to be \\nadopted by Gladys and Juan. All three women were concerned about the \\npossibility that if adopted, Rita might become the object of a custody \\ndispute between Gladys and Juan in the event that their separation \\nended in divorce. Judge Yates ordered a continuance. \\nIn April, when Rita’s case appeared before Judge Yates again, the \\ncast of characters had changed slightly. Rita and Gladys were present \\nwith Kiladis, and DPW was represented by Grace Myers and Susan \\nGoldman. David Slade again did not appear.

She said that she felt badly about \\ntelling me his wrong name, and that she had known his \\nname all along. \\nKiladis remembered checking with Susan Goldman from DPW to \\nsee if the social worker knew of any “Joe” or “Joey” at the Home.

He had little contact with the kids, Susan thinks, but \\nsays that since Rita was often sick with ear infections and \\nofficially confined to bed in her cottage, what the child says \\nis possible. Susan promises to check into it, if just because \\nshe is under pressure to get greater accountability from \\npeople and places that DPW uses for placement. \\nWhile Kiladis and Maynard were both convinced that Juan had \\nnever abused Rita sexually or in any other way, Maynard had reminded \\nKiladis of the many other opportunities in Rita’s environment for sexual \\nexposure or stimulation: with other children at each of the two foster \\nhomes; with other children at the Catholic Home; with children in the \\nneighborhood around Gladys’s home; when Rita stayed at Carlota’s \\nhouse or even at the home of her Aunt Maria. \\nYet Kiladis had always been puzzled by the timing of the Home’s \\nplacement of Rita with the Biancos. Even the Home’s psychologist, who \\nfiled the CY47, had put into his report at that time that he did not “think \\nthis is an appropriate time to attempt to place this child in a foster home. \\nHer power and control struggles, her volatile emotional state mean that \\nshe will be a considerable handful for any foster parents.” Perhaps, as \\nKiladis believed, someone at the Home knew that the “father figure” \\nreferred to in the report, who was exposing the child to “sexual \\noverstimulation,” was actually a member of their own staff. Rita then \\nhad been whisked out to Jenkintown for protection, not from Juan but \\nfrom Joe. \\nAlthough convinced by this evidence that there had been sexual \\nabuse at the Home, Kiladis was not committed to the idea of suing the \\nHome on behalf of Gladys and Rita. She knew that type of trial was a \\nvery difficult one. Rita, who was not an easy child to deal with, would be \\nplaced in a very vulnerable position. Old wounds would be reopened. \\nGladys’s anger and feelings of betrayal by the Home, an institution \\nwhich was supposed to have helped Rita, would be rekindled. \\nAs Maynard returned to his office, Kiladis thought about how \\nmany other loose ends remained in this case, as in most others like it. \\nPLA knew many things about the family that DPW did not know.

Where did Maynard’s and Kiladis’s duty \\nto their client begin and end? What did it require them to overlook, and \\nwhat did it require them to pursue? Should they leave Rita’s case, and \\nclose the file? \\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS \\n1. Rita’s case reflects many of the central themes of this book. \\nPerhaps the most crucial is the definition of the lawyer’s role—or, more \\naccurately, the need for self-definition, which lawyers confront \\nthroughout their legal careers. Of the three lawyers who figure in the \\ncase, one remains in the background. David Slade, Rita’s court -\\nappointed attorney, plays at best a walk-on part, largely, it seems, by \\nhis own choice. As seen through Maynard’s eyes, Slade has chosen to \\noffer technical expertise but little sensitivity to the personal and \\nrelational aspects of his cases. This downtown lawyer leaves “no legal \\nstone unturned” but finds it unnecessary actually to meet with Rita. \\nMaynard’s judgment of Slade’s performance is unsympathetic. How \\nmight Slade himself assess his representation? What might account for \\nhis conduct? \\n2. The other two lawyers in the case, Maynard and Kiladis, \\ndefine their roles quite differently. Maynard sees his function primarily \\nas representing Gladys, the Legal Aid Society’s client: \\nI did not decide that I was the lawyer to the whole situation \\nto decide what was best for Rita. Within certain limits, I \\nreally did and do allow my role as an advocate in the \\nsituation to take its course. \\nKiladis, by contrast, admits: \\nIt wasn’t clear whose attorney I was; what I was advocating \\nfor, and so on. Knowing Rita’s needs as well as Gladys’s and \\neventually even Carlota’s created a lot of tension for me. \\nTheir needs were different and it was not clear how to \\nbargain them out; whether to try to get the maximum good \\nfor everyone or just for our client, Gladys. \\n3. In the end, is it clear how Kiladis resolves this tension? Is \\nit appropriate for her even to consider trying “to get the maximum good \\nfor everyone” rather than only for Gladys? Does this approach breach \\nany obligations to the client? On the other hand, Maynard is convinced \\n26'),\n",

Suppose that you were one of the Legal Aid attorneys in \\nthis case. If you believed that the best outcome for Gladys would be \\ninconsistent with the best outcome for Rita, would that affect your choice \\nof roles? Would your answer turn on the inadequacy of Rita’s \\nrepresentation by David Slade? If so, what about other individuals \\nwhose interests were unrepresented—Juan, Carlota, the children in the \\nCatholic home? How should such concerns affect attorneys’ ethical \\nobligations? \\n5. What factors should guide lawyers in choosing between the \\nrole of advocate and what Maynard calls “lawyer to the whole situation”? \\nConsider the following issues. \\nThe Law of Lawyering \\nTo what extent do the rules dictate a particular role? Should a \\nlawyer be subject to discipline for choosing the “wrong” role? Did either \\nMaynard’s or Kiladis’s approach violate any of the bar’s codified \\nrequirements? See Rules 1.2, 1.3, and 2.1. \\nThe Traditions and Practices of the Bar \\nTo what extent do the conventional practices and traditions of the \\nbar help lawyers define their obligations in circumstances like Rita’s \\ncase? What if there are competing norms and traditions? Obviously, the \\nzealous advocate is a well-established role, but so is the nonpartisan \\ncounselor who attempts to reconcile competing interests. Maynard’s \\nterm “lawyer to the whole situation” paraphrases Supreme Court \\nJustice Louis Brandeis’s description of his own practice of mediating \\nbetween clients and other parties.1  As Chapter 4 makes clear, \\nBrandeis’s approach has been highly influential. \\nThe role of “lawyer for the situation” implies greater \\nindependence from the client than the advocate’s role. Thus Brandeis  \\nonce wrote in a memorandum to himself: “Advise client what he should \\nhave—not what he wants.” 2  How desirable is this role definition? Is it \\nthe one Kiladis adopted? Should it matter whether the client can afford \\nto hire another attorney who might see the issues differently? \\n \\n1 See John P. Frank, The Legal Ethics of Louis D. Brandeis, 17 STAN. L.

Should so important an issue be \\nleft to the preferences of individual attorneys? Is there any practical \\nalternative? \\nConfidentiality, Advocacy, and Contextual Decision Making \\nHow easily can or should lawyers shift from one role to another \\ndepending upon the particular context? Maynard acknowledges that if \\nhe had believed that Rita was being abused in Gladys’s home, he might \\nnot have adopted the advocate’s stance. So too, Kiladis’s choice of role \\napparently depended in large measure on the inadequacy of \\nrepresentation of a vulnerable child. In a different context, she might \\nnot have experienced the same tensions in the advocate’s role. \\nIf such contextual factors affect a lawyer’s definition of role, do \\nthey also impose any obligations to third parties? If Maynard had known \\nof child abuse, should he have disclosed it? Should Kiladis have informed \\nthe Biancos and Carlota that they were entitled to court-appointed \\nattorneys? \\n6. At the end of the case, Maynard and Kiladis are \\ndeliberating about whether to sue the Catholic Home for Children. \\nKiladis has become convinced that a child abuser works as one of the \\nHome’s groundskeepers, but fears that such a suit might have \\ndevastating effects on Rita and Gladys. Yet failing to bring formal \\ncharges could endanger other children. How should the lawyers resolve \\nthis dilemma? Should the considerations be different for “an advocate” \\nthan for a “lawyer for the situation”? Are there any alternatives besides \\nlitigation that might avoid the dilemma? \\n7. Are any of Maynard’s and Kiladis’s legal tactics \\nproblematic? For example, is it appropriate for them to “neutralize” \\nother professionals in the case: the psychiatrists at St. Christopher’s, \\nMary Nota, Margaret Kamin, Susan Goldman, and Grace Myers? \\nKiladis withholds from Grace Myers, a law school acquaintance, the \\nbelief that Gladys is unable to care for Rita without outside support \\nservices, as well as the knowledge that the legal basis for Gladys’s \\nguardianship is dubious.

Under what, if any, circumstances \\nshould a lawyer reveal such facts? See Rules 1.2(d), 1.6, 3.3, and 4.1. \\n8. Maynard and Kiladis have several private conversations \\nwith DPW personnel, including Mary Nota and Margaret Kamin. From \\none perspective, these conversations appear perfectly appropriate: \\nGladys’s lawyers should be able to discuss her case with the relevant \\nofficials. However, Maynard and Kiladis structure these encounters for \\nadversarial purposes; the objective is to “neutralize” the officials. DPW \\nhas its own legal counsel, and Rule 4.2 forbids lawyers to engage in ex \\nparte contacts with other represented parties unless authorized by law. \\nDid Maynard and Kiladis violate this Rule? Or were the conversations \\nthe kind of communications with government officials that are \\n“authorized” by law? Did Kiladis’s extensive personal involvement with \\nRita without David Slade’s consent violate Rule 4.2? Did it violate \\nconflict of interest rules that require a lawyer to maintain independent \\nprofessional judgment? \\n9. Another important issue in Rita’s case involves the \\nallocation of power between lawyers and clients. In theory, attorneys are \\nagents of those they represent. In practice, the Legal Aid lawyers in this \\ncase “whether knowingly or unknowingly, [often] steered clients’ \\nchoices.” For example, at one point Maynard talks Gladys out of seeking \\nimmediate visitation rights, because “his legal instincts told him he \\ncould best manage the case by drawing things out for quite awhile \\ndespite Gladys’s desire to act immediately.” When Maynard advises \\nGladys that they should not immediately seek visitation because they \\ncould not win, is he giving her any real choice? Such opposition to the \\nclient’s wishes for the client’s own good is an example of paternalism, \\ndiscussed more fully in Chapter 5. Under what circumstances is it \\njustified? Is paternalism ever consistent with the advocate’s role? See \\nRules 1.2(a) and 1.14. \\n10. In the end, Gladys adopts Rita. Is this an outcome that \\nGladys genuinely desires, or is it an instance of lawyers’ shaping client \\nchoices to fit the legal alternatives readily available? From the outset of \\nthe case, Gladys expresses ambivalence. She wants to keep Rita, but she \\nalso wants public agencies to provide care in those intervals when she is \\nunable to cope. Should Kiladis and Maynard have tried to formalize such \\nan arrangement rather than pursuing adoption? What would the likely \\nresponse have been by the court, by welfare officials, or by Rita’s \\nattorney? Does the adoption raise other ethical concerns?

Or was \\nit required by their duties of confidentiality and zealous advocacy? \\nAnswering these questions involves close parsing of both the \\nModel Rules on confidentiality, truthfulness, and honesty, and \\nRestatement standards on what counts as fraud by omission. But it also \\nrequires you to think about the nature of adversary litigation. \\nThe case is doubly interesting because the Supreme Court had an \\nopportunity to answer these questions, but instead ducked the issue—\\nwhich therefore remains a live one. \\nAnother ethics question concerns the tactics of government \\nlawyers, who may have been drawing out the litigation to delay the \\nabortion until it was too late.  \\n__________ \\nThe case concerns litigation in 2017 involving Jane Doe, a 17-year \\nold held in Texas in immigration detention, who learned while in \\ndetention that she was pregnant, and sought an abortion. Texas law \\nrequires that anyone seeking an abortion must undergo counseling at \\nleast 24 hours in advance, by the same physician who will perform the \\nabortion. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR)—in charge of her \\ndetention—denied her permission to leave the detention facility for the \\nabortion procedure itself, because in ORR’s view that would be \\nfacilitating the abortion. According to ORR policy, a n undocumented \\nminor has only two pathways to release from immigration detention: she \\ncan accept voluntary departure back to her country of origin, or she can \\nfind an adult sponsor in the United States to whom she can be released. \\nSuch a sponsor must be vetted by HHS, a potentially time -consuming \\nprocess.

Jane Doe’s guardian \\nad litem, working in tandem with the ACLU, challenged the ORR policy \\nin federal district court as a violation of Jane Doe’s constitutional right \\nto an abortion, and requested a court order to force the government to \\nrelease her to the Texas clinic where the abortion would take place. That \\nwas on October 13, 2017. The District Court agreed with her on October \\n18, and issued the order. The government appealed to the D.C. Circuit \\nCourt of Appeals, and two days later (October 20), a divided panel of the \\nD.C. Circuit reversed. Jane Doe requested an emergency en banc \\nrehearing, and the D.C. Circuit sitting en banc  reversed the panel \\ndecision and ordered the government not to prevent her release; two \\nhours later, the District Court amended the order to require the \\ngovernment to release Jane Doe immediately. That was at 4 p.m. on \\nOctober 24. \\n The subsequent events are described in the briefs below; because \\nthe two sides “spin” these facts rather differently, we will not fully \\ndescribe them here. In (very) brief: Jane Doe had received the legally-\\nrequired abortion counseling prior to the last-minute litigation; but at \\nthe time of her courtroom victory on October 24, the physician who \\ncounseled her was not available to perform the procedure. It appeared, \\nthen, that a different physician would counsel her on October 25, and \\nshe would have the abortion on October 26. \\nBut the night of October 24, the original physician became \\navailable. Jane Doe’s representatives pushed her October 25 medical \\nappointment back from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 a.m., and informed the \\ngovernment of the change in schedule. They did not inform the \\ngovernment that the appointment’s purpose had changed from \\ncounseling to the abortion itself.  \\nThe upshot was that: \\n1. Jane Doe was released from detention at 4:15 a.m. on October \\n25 and had the abortion a few hours later. In the 12 hours between the \\ncourt order and the abortion, the government did not file an emergency \\nappeal for a stay with the Supreme Court to prevent the abortion. \\n2. The government accused Jane Doe’s counsel of deceiving them \\nabout the timing of the abortion. Specifically, Jane Doe’s counsel did not \\ninform them that her appointment for counseling was changed at the \\nlast minute to an appointment for the abortion itself.

There was reason to believe that prolonged legal proceedings, \\ncoupled with the government’s proposed vetting of potential sponsors for \\nJane Doe on an uncertain timetable, would delay the proposed abortion \\nbeyond the legal cut-off date. \\nSecond, Scott Lloyd, the head of ORR, made his strong opposition \\nto abortion clear in a public statement regarding another case, involving \\n“Jane Poe.” Jane Poe was a minor in ORR detention who was pregnant \\ndue to rape. In declining to permit her temporary release to obtain an \\nabortion, Mr. Lloyd explained that his decision was guided by the belief \\nthat abortion is never in the best interests of a minor. That is because of \\nthe potential trauma and regret over aborting one’s child. He added: \\nI am mindful that abortion is offered by some as a solution \\nto a rape. …  \\nI disagree. Implicit here are the dubious notions that it is \\npossible to cure violence with further violence, and that the \\ndestruction of an unborn child’s life can in some instances \\nbe acceptable as a means to an end. To decline to assist in \\nan abortion here is to decline to participate in violence \\nagainst an innocent life.  \\nMr. Lloyd concluded: \\nThe Office of Refugee Resettlement serves a large number \\nof persons who have experienced some sort of violence. \\nRefuge is the basis of our name and is at the core of what \\nwe provide, and we provide this to all the minors in our \\ncare, including their unborn children…. 3 \\nMr. Lloyd’s statement came during the pendency of the cert petition, \\nand made matters somewhat awkward for government lawyers.

When Ms. Doe could not \\nreceive counseling from a physician on the evening of October 24, her \\nrepresentatives informed the government that her appointment would be \\nmoved to the morning of October 25, pushing the abortion procedure to October \\n26. The government asked to be kept informed of the timing of Ms. Doe’s \\nabortion procedure, and one of respondent’s counsel agreed to do so. \\n  \\nBased on those representations, the government informed this Court’s \\nClerk’s Office and respondent’s counsel that it would file a stay application the \\nfollowing morning, October 25. At that point, by their own account, Ms. Doe’s \\nrepresentatives did three things: they secured the services of Ms. Doe’s original \\nphysician (who had provided counseling the previous week), moved her \\nappointment from 7:30 to 4:15 a.m. on the morning of October 25, and changed \\nthe appointment from counseling to an abortion. Although Ms. Doe’s \\nrepresentatives informed the government of the change in timing, they did not \\ninform the government of the other two developments— which kept the \\ngovernment in the dark about wh en Ms. Doe was scheduled to have an \\nabortion. The government did not learn that critical fact until shelter personnel \\narrived with Ms. Doe at the clinic for her early -morning appointment on \\nOctober 25. The government’s efforts to reach respondent’s counsel were met \\nwith silence, until approximately 10 a.m. Eastern Time, when one of \\nrespondent’s counsel notified the government that Ms. Doe had undergone an \\nabortion. . . .   \\n   \\nCounsel’s representations to the district court on October 24 confirmed \\nthat Ms. Doe would need to participate in a new counseling session and then \\nwait a day before she could undergo an abortion. Counsel asked the court to \\norder the government to make Ms. Doe available “promptly and without delay, \\non such dates, including today, *** in order to obtain the counseling required \\n48'),\n",

Counsel thus reaffirmed to the court \\nthat for Ms. Doe to obtain an abortion, she would need to complete a two-step, \\n24-hour process.\\nb. Following the district court’s entry of the modified TRO at\\napproximately 5 p.m. on October 24, counsel made similar representations \\ndirectly to the government. First, Ms. Doe’s guardian ad litem, attorney ad \\nlitem, and counsel from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) all \\nrequested that the Texas shelter transport Ms. Doe to the clinic immediately. \\nAt 6:13 p.m. on October 24, government counsel contacted respondent’s counsel \\nby telephone, confirming that she was being transported to the clinic and \\nasking to be apprised of the timing of any appointments. Government counsel \\nfollowed up with an email to respondent’s counsel, confirming that the shelter \\nwas transporting Ms. Doe to the clinic on October 24, and asking to be notified \\nof the timing of “tomorrow’s procedure.” At 6:28 p.m., respondent’s counsel \\nconfirmed receipt of the email and phone call, and assured government counsel \\nthat “[a]s soon as we understand the clinic’s schedule tomorrow we will let you \\nknow.”  \\nRoughly 45 minutes later, respondent’s counsel informed government \\ncounsel that the doctor was not able to stay for the appointment that evening, \\nwhich would be rescheduled for the following morning at 7:30 a.m. Around the \\nsame time, Ms. Doe’s attorney ad litem separately informed the assigned \\nAssistant United States Attorney (AUSA) that Ms. Doe’s previous doctor was \\nnot available; that it was no longer feasible for Ms. Doe to receive counseling \\nthat evening (October 24); and that as a result the abortion could not take place \\nuntil October 26. Ms. Doe’s attorney ad litem further stated that the doctor had \\nagreed to stay for an extra day, in order to perform the abortion on October 26. \\nc. These representations made clear that the appointment rescheduled\\nfor the morning of October 25 would be for counseling, with an abortion to \\nfo\\nllow no earlier than the morning of October 26. By their own \\nacknowledgement, respondent’s counsel shared that understanding. See Letter \\nfrom David D. Cole, Nat’l Legal Dir., Am. Civil Liberties Union, to Noel J. \\nFrancisco, Solicitor Gen. 2 (Oct. 30, 2017) (ACLU Letter) (lodg ed with the \\nCourt) (“We did not become aware, until late in the evening of October 24, that \\nit might be possible for the physician who had counseled Ms. Doe on October \\n19 to return to the clinic to perform the abortion on the morning of October 25. \\nIt was not clear until the morning of October 25 that he would in fact be able \\nto do so.”). … \\nLater that night, Ms. Doe’s guardian ad litem informed the Texas \\nshelter and the AUSA that Ms. Doe’s appointment had been moved to 4:15 a.m. \\nCentral Time. The email did not explain the reason for the change nor state \\nthat the appointment was now for an abortion.

Although the change in the appointment \\ntime caused shelter staff to wonder later that night whether the nature of the \\nappointment also might have changed, they were never told that the early -\\nmorning appointment would be for an abortion rather than counseling. \\n  \\nRespondent’s counsel has now explained that, unbeknownst to the \\ngovernment, at some point “late in the evening of October 24,” they became \\n“aware” that “it might be possible for the physician who had counseled Ms. Doe \\non October 19 to return to the clinic to perform the abortion on the morning of \\nOctober 25.” Respondent’s counsel has further explained that at some point \\nearly in the morning of October 25, it became “clear” that the original doctor \\n“would in fact be able to” perform the procedure that morning. Significantly, \\nhowever, respondent’s counsel did not notify the government of this \\npossibility— notwithstanding their earlier acquiescence in a request to keep \\ngovernment counsel informed of the ti ming of the “procedure” and the \\ngovernment’s subsequent notice of its intent to seek relief in this Court that \\nsame morning. \\n  \\nAt 4:15 a.m. Central Time on the morning of October 25, shelter staff \\narrived with Ms. Doe at the clinic.

After receiving that information, \\ngovernment counsel twice emailed respondent’s counsel to inquire as to the \\nnature of the appointment. Two hours after the government’s first email was \\nsent, counsel informed the government that Ms. Doe “had the abortion this \\nmorning.” Because these developments precluded any possibility of effective \\nrelief, the government did not file its stay application with the Court. . . . \\n  \\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \\nThis appeal presented the question whether the government must \\nfacilitate access to an abortion that is not medically necessary to preserve the \\nlife or health of an unaccompanied alien minor who was apprehended \\nunlawfully entering the United States, who declines to request voluntary \\ndeparture to her home country, who has not yet identified a qualified sponsor \\nto whom she can be released, and who thus is in the government’s custody.

Pursuant to a policy adopted in March 2017 by the Director of the Office \\nof Refugee Resettlement (ORR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human \\nServices (HHS)— and in stark contrast to the policies of U.S. Immigration and \\nCustoms Enforcement (ICE) and  the Bureau of Prisons (BOP)— the \\ngovernment refused to allow Ms. Doe to attend any abortion -related \\nappointments. \\nMs. Doe brought suit in federal district court seeking to enforce her \\nright to an abortion, consistent with the Constitution and the state cou rt’s \\norder. The government did not contest Ms. Doe’s claim that she has a \\nconstitutional right to an abortion. Nor did it argue that allowing her to attend \\nthe appointments would violate statutory restrictions on the use of federal \\nfunds or any federal regulations. Instead, it argued that it should not have to \\n“facilitate” her access to an abortion— even if it did not pay for, or transport \\nMs. Doe to, any appointments. Because she was in federal custody, this policy \\nprevented Ms. Doe from exercising what the government did not contest is her \\nconstitutional right. \\nOn October 18, 2017, the district court issued a temporary restraining \\norder (TRO) that, among other things, directed the defendants to allow Ms. \\nDoe to attend the necessary appointments. The same day, the government \\nsought an emergency stay pending appeal, which a panel of the D.C. Circuit \\ngranted in part on October 20. On October 24, however, the D.C. Circuit en \\nbanc granted rehearing and denied the government’s emergency request for a \\nstay. This time, the government did not seek an immediate stay, even though \\nnothing precluded it from doing so. On the next day, October 25, one month \\nafter the state court authorized Ms. Doe to obtain an abortion, she finally had \\nthe procedure. \\nHaving failed to seek an emergency stay from this Court on October 24, \\nas it had from the D.C. Circuit on the day the district court granted the TRO, \\nthe government filed this petition nine days after the events that it claims have \\nrendered the issues in this case moot. The government does not seek review of \\nthe single legal issue decided by the court of appeals — whether the \\ngovernment’s application for a stay pending appeal met the standards for \\nobtaining such relief. Rather, it asks this Court to vacate that emergency, \\ninterlocutory ruling on the ground that some of Ms. Doe’s claims for relief have \\nbeen mooted by her abortion. The government then suggests that this Court \\nshould decide, in the first instance, that claims Ms. Doe seeks to bring on behalf \\nof herself and a class are likewise moot and dismiss those claims now while \\nthey remain pending in district court. Simultaneously, the government \\nsuggests that this Court should consider issuing an order to show cause why \\ndisciplinary action should not be taken against respondent’s counsel “in light \\nof the extraordinary circumstances of this case.” . . . \\n[Eds.: The response to the ethics complaint:] \\n \\n  Finally, the government’s suggestion that this Court should consider \\nissuing an order to show cause why respondent’s counsel should not be \\ndisciplined provides no basis to find that counsel’s conduct presents grounds \\n53'),\n",

The petition does not present legal or factual \\ngrounds for its suggestion that respondent’s counsel may have violated any \\napplicable rule of professional conduct. To the contrary, the government’s \\nrecitation of events shows that it failed to seek a stay from thi s Court in a \\ntimely manner based on assumptions it made about the timing of Ms. Doe’s \\nprocedure, not on the basis of any commitments from Ms. Doe’s lawyers. \\nCOUNTERSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \\nA. Facts \\nIn early September 2017, Jane Doe, a young woman of 17, enter ed the \\nUnited States without her parents. She was apprehended by U.S. authorities \\nand placed in HHS custody in a shelter run by a federal government grantee \\nin Texas. . . . A nationwide consent decree requires ORR and its shelters to \\nprovide “appropriate routine medical . . . care, family planning services, and \\nemergency health care services.”  \\nOn March 4, 2017, the Acting Director of ORR issued a letter informing \\ngrantees of its policy of “prohibit[ing] [shelters] from taking any action that \\nfacilitates an  abortion without direction and approval from the Director of \\nORR,” a policy that effectively gives the ORR Director veto power over a young \\nwoman’s abortion decision. \\nOnce in HHS custody, Ms. Doe was given a medical examination and \\ntold that she was pregn ant. She informed her custodians that she wished to \\nterminate the pregnancy. ORR directed the shelter to inform Ms. Doe’s mother \\nof her pregnancy over Ms. Doe’s objection. The government also required Ms. \\nDoe to attend a counseling session at an anti-abortion center.  \\nTo obtain an abortion under Texas law, a minor must obtain parental \\nconsent or a court order finding that she “is mature and sufficiently well \\ninformed to make the decision” on her own, or that “the notification and \\nattempt to obtain consent would not be in the best interest of the minor.” A \\nstate court appointed a guardian ad litem and an attorney ad litem for Ms. Doe \\nand, with their assistance, she received a court order on September 25 granting \\nher authority to consent to an abortion without the knowledge or consent of \\nher parents or legal guardian.  \\nUnder Texas law, Ms. Doe first had to attend counseling at least 24 \\nhours in advance of the abortion with the physician who would perform the \\nprocedure. When Ms. Doe requested permission to attend that counseling on \\nSeptember 27, ORR refused. \\nORR took this position notwithstanding contrary ICE and BOP policies \\nthat allow detained women to obtain abortions, and despite the government’s \\nposition in this case that Ms. Doe would have been free to have an abortion if \\nORR placed her with a sponsor. \\nB. Procedural History  \\n[For space purposes, we omit the procedural history as rehearsed by \\nthis brief; it was explained in the introduction above.]  \\nAt this point in time, the government could have immediately sought a \\n54'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 56}, page_content='stay from this Court, just as it had immediately sought a stay from the court \\nof appeals when the district court entered the TRO. But it chose not to. \\nFollowing the D.C. Circuit’s decision, Ms. Doe’s guardian ad litem filed \\nan emergency motion to amend the TRO in the district court. The district court \\ngranted the motion shortly after 4 p.m. on October 24 and issued an amended \\nTRO that required the defendants to transport Ms. Doe, or allow her to be \\ntransported, “promptly and without delay, on such dates, including today, and \\nto such Texas abortion provider as shall be specified by [Ms. Doe’s] guardian \\nad litem or attorney ad litem, in order to obtain the counseling required by \\nstate law and to obtain the abortion procedure, in accordance with the abortion \\nproviders’ availability and any medical requirements.” Again, the government \\ncould have sought a stay from this Court at this point, but did not. \\n C. Post-TRO Events \\n  Upon receiving the amended TRO at about 4:15 p.m., Ms. Doe’s \\nguardian ad litem emailed shelter and Department of Justice (DOJ) personnel \\nrequesting that they transport Ms. Doe to the clinic. Despite the court order, \\nthe shelter responded that it would have to wait for ORR instructions. In \\nresponse, Ms. Doe’s attorney attached the court’s order and advised the shelter \\nthat she would initiate contempt proceedings if the government defied the \\norder.  \\nSoon thereafter, a DOJ attorney called Ms. Doe’s attorney to inform her \\nthat the shelter was transporting Ms. Doe. The DO J attorney explained that \\nthe shelter needed advance notice “of the timing of any appointments,” \\ngovernment counsel emailed Ms. Doe’s attorney to thank her for speaking \\nearlier and “to confirm [the attorney’s] understanding that the shelter had \\narranged fo r transport services this evening per your email.” Government \\ncounsel continued: “I would appreciate it if you could let me and [the Assistant \\nU.S. Attorney (AUSA) in Texas] know when the timing for tomorrow’s \\nprocedure is clarified.” Ms. Doe’s attorney replied minutes later stating that \\nshe appreciated the call, and that “[a]s soon as we understand the clinic’s \\nschedule tomorrow we will let you know.” \\nShortly after 6:00 p.m., shelter personnel emailed HHS and DOJ \\npersonnel that Ms. Doe’s attorney ad litem had informed them that “the \\nwindow for appointment this evening was missed,” and Ms. Doe should return \\nto the shelter.  \\n  At 6:17 p.m., Ms. Doe’s attorney emailed DOJ attorneys to say that the \\ndoctor was unable to stay that evening, and that “[t]he ad litems will arrange \\nwith the shelter to have [Ms. Doe] arrive at the clinic at 7:30 a.m.” the next \\nmorning. A few minutes later, Ms. Doe’s guardian informed shelter and DOJ \\npersonnel that Ms. Doe “has an appointment tomorrow morning at 7:30 a.m.” \\nat the clinic and “must be there on time.” The shelter confirmed that it would \\nmake “necessary arrangements to ensure minor is present.”  \\n  At 8:13 p.m., another DOJ attorney emailed Ms. Doe’s attorneys to say \\nthat DOJ intended to seek a stay from the Supreme Court the  next morning. \\nOne of Ms. Doe’s attorneys emailed back to thank the attorney for letting him \\n55'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 57}, page_content='know. \\nAt 9:31 p.m., Ms. Doe’s guardian ad litem informed shelter and DOJ \\npersonnel that Ms. Doe’s “appointment has been moved to 4:15 a.m. at the \\naddress provided.” The shelter again confirmed receipt and indicated it had \\nmade transportation arrangements. Shelter personnel forwarded the email to \\nHHS personnel at 11:56 p.m. to inform them that it had “not received \\nconfirmation of what service will take place tomorrow , we were under the \\nimpression [Ms. Doe] was going in for mandated counseling, however, provided \\nnewly requested time was issued at the request of health center and attending \\nphysician, it is unclear whether [Ms. Doe] will partake in mandated counseling \\nor undergo medical procedure.”  \\n  At 4:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 25, shelter personnel emailed HHS \\npersonnel stating that the “health center charge nurse has confirmed that \\nminor is scheduled to undergo medical procedure this morning.” (emphasis \\nadded). \\nAfter 8 a.m. that morning, Ms. Doe’s abortion was performed by the \\ndoctor who had originally counseled her on October 19. In response to DOJ \\ninquiries, Ms. Doe’s attorney confirmed this fact in an email at 9:00 a.m.  \\n  Although the petition states that at the time Ms. Doe had her abortion \\nthe government “believed that it had identified a potentially suitable sponsor,” \\nand “believed that the process could be completed within a week,” it is now \\nmore than a month later, and the government still has not approved a sponsor; \\nMs. Doe remains in ORR custody. Had it not been for court intervention, Ms. \\nDoe would still be pregnant, against her will, today. \\nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \\n. . . \\n IV. THERE IS NO BASIS FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST \\nRESPONDENT’S COUNSEL. \\nThe government’s concluding suggestion that this Court “may wish to \\nissue an order to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken” \\nagainst respondent’s counsel, Pet. 26, is both extraordinary and baseless. It \\nfinds no support in the facts or the law. \\n  The government’s recitation of events shows that: (1) Ms. Doe’s counsel \\nmade a series of accurate statements concerning the availability of, and \\nlogistics surrounding, Ms. Doe’s ability to obtain an abortion; (2) some \\ngovernment personnel may have incorrectly assumed that Ms. Doe could not \\nobtain an abortion before October 26, even though she was legally entitled to \\nobtain an immediate abortion, and had received state-mandated counseling on \\nOctober 19; (3) some government lawye rs may have believed that Ms. Doe’s \\ncounsel would advise them if facts changed; and (4) Ms. Doe’s counsel did not \\ntake affirmative steps to notify the government that the doctor who provided \\nthe counseling on October 19 agreed to come back to the clinic. The \\ngovernment’s suggestion that this might amount to sanctionable misconduct is \\n56'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 58}, page_content='not supported by legal authorities regarding attorney conduct, is not remotely \\njustified by the disciplinary cases it cites, and is contrary to counsel’s respective \\nethical duties. \\n  In an effort to show otherwise, the government repeatedly claims that \\nopposing counsel “represented” “that no abortion would take place until \\nOctober 26.” Yet no such representation appears in the emails or the \\ndeclaration of the AUSA lodged with th e Court by the Solicitor General that \\nthe government cites. Instead, the events recited in the petition indicate that \\nMs. Doe’s representatives stated at various times on October 24 that the \\nphysician who was available at the clinic on October 24 (who was not the \\nphysician who originally provided the state -mandated counseling) could \\nprovide a new counseling session, which would trigger a 24 -hour waiting \\nperiod. The government does not claim that any of these statements was false. \\n  The government also point s to statements that respondent’s counsel \\nmade to the district court on October 24. The petition states that respondent’s \\ncounsel represented to the court “that for Ms. Doe to obtain an abortion, she \\nwould need to complete a two -step, 24-hour process.” But this misrepresents \\ncounsel’s filing. Counsel requested an amendment to the original TRO to make \\nclear that its relief and the government’s obligation to transport or allow Ms. \\nDoe to be transported should be effective that very day. In support of this \\nchange, counsel noted that “a qualified physician is available at the nearest \\nclinic today, and will be available to perform the procedure tomorrow.” The \\nmotion specifically noted that it sought to ensure that Ms. Doe could “obtain \\nthe abortion . . . without further delay and as may be required by Texas state \\nlaw and the availability of physicians.” (emphases added). The motion thereby \\nmade clear that the TRO should enable Ms. Doe to obtain an abortion at the \\nearliest time and from any available physician. \\n  As this motion underscores, Ms. Doe’s counsel did not represent that, \\nin making arrangements for her to see the physician who was at the clinic on \\nOctober 24, they were forswearing any effort to secure an appointment with \\nany other doctor who might be able  to provide the abortion. Indeed, the \\ngovernment knew— and by its own account acknowledged to Ms. Doe’s \\nrepresentative on October 24 — that the original doctor could perform the \\nprocedure without the need to repeat counseling. It also knew that Ms. Doe’s \\nrepresentatives were considering various logistical arrangements to ensure \\nthat a doctor would be available to provide her abortion. These facts show that \\nthe situation was fluid; Ms. Doe’s representatives were considering multiple \\nalternatives; and they were seeking to obtain Ms. Doe’s long-delayed abortion \\nas soon as possible. The government implies that it reasonably believed these \\nalternatives did not include any effort to return the original doctor to the \\nfacility, and claims that Ms. Doe’s attorney ad litem had stated that this doctor \\n“was not available,” But this suggestion rests on yet another misleading \\nparaphrase: According to the government’s own declaration, the attorney ad \\nlitem stated that the original doctor “was not available on October 24. ” \\n(emphasis added). The government does not claim that the statement actually \\nmade was inaccurate, or that it was a representation that Ms. Doe’s counsel \\nwould make no effort to have that doctor return to the facility on October 25. \\n57'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 59}, page_content='The government also points to a telephone call and exchanges of emails \\non October 24 in an effort to suggest that respondent’s counsel provided \\nassurances that the government did not need to request a stay because the \\nabortion would not occur until October 26. Specifically, the government makes \\nmuch of an email exchange in which one of its lawyers said the attorney “would \\nappreciate it if [Ms. Doe’s counsel] could let me and [the AUSA] know when \\nthe timing for tomorrow’s procedure is clarified,” and Ms. Doe’s counsel stated \\nthat “[a]s soon as we understand the clinic’s schedule tomorrow we will let you \\nknow.”  \\n  The government takes this exchange entirely out of context. Less than \\nan hour earlier, the shelter had refused to transport Ms. Doe to the clinic until \\nit had ORR’s approval, and the government had been advised that opposing \\ncounsel would “initiate contempt proceedings” if Ms. Doe was not transported \\nto the clinic promptly. The government attorney called respondent’s counsel \\nshortly thereafter to explain that the shelter needed advance notice to arrange \\ntransportation, and to confirm that Ms. Doe was now being transported to the \\nclinic. The government attorney then sent the email that confirmed “[the \\nattorney’s] understanding that the shelter had arranged for transport services \\nthis evening per your email,” and included the attorney’s request for \\ninformation about the timing of “tomorrow’s procedure.”  \\n  In context, the email exchange merely documents the government’s \\ncompliance with its obligation under the TRO to provide transpor tation, its \\ncommitment to do so again the following day, and counsel’s agreement to let \\nthe government know when Ms. Doe needed to be at the clinic the next day to \\navoid any further problems with transportation. Critically, the government’s \\nemail does not mention any stay motion, let alone link the request to the timing \\nof such a filing. Nor does the government claim that its attorney mentioned \\nany stay application in the earlier call. It is now wishful thinking to argue that \\nthis exchange over transportation logistics reflects a mutual understanding \\nthat the government need not seek a stay because opposing counsel “had \\nrepresented to the government that . . .  no abortion would occur until the \\nmorning of October 26.”  \\n  The government’s claim is further beli ed by the email exchange the \\ngovernment points to from later in the evening of October 24. The government \\nasserts that, “[b]ased on the representations of counsel that no abortion would \\noccur until October 26,” it informed the Clerk’s Office and respondent’s counsel \\nthat it would seek a stay the morning of October 25. But by the government’s \\nown account, no communication about the timing of a motion for a stay \\noccurred until 8:13 p.m. the night of October 24 and, even then, the email the \\ngovernment sent informing respondent’s counsel that it would seek a stay in \\nthe morning says nothing about any such representations. Nor does it \\ncommunicate the government’s “understanding” about the timing of the \\nprocedure or seek confirmation that respondent’s counsel shared that \\nunderstanding, much less a commitment that her counsel would promptly \\nadvise the government of any changed circumstances. The response from one \\nof Ms. Doe’s lawyers likewise includes no such confirmation or commitment. \\nIndeed, one of her attorneys responded to the 8:13 p.m. email by expressing \\n58'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\case study-2.pdf', 'page': 60}, page_content='relief that he would not have to check his email for any stay motion filed later \\nthat night. That email indicates that Ms. Doe’s attorneys had expected the \\ngovernment to seek a stay that night—an expectation wholly inconsistent with \\nthe government’s suggestion that there was a mutual understanding that filing \\nwas unnecessary because Ms. Doe’s counsel has represented that the abortion \\nwould not occur until October 26. \\n  The Solicitor General argues that these st atements and events of \\nOctober 24 led some government personnel to assume that Ms. Doe would not \\nbe able to obtain an abortion prior to October 26. But none of the statements \\nthe government cites was a representation, much less a commitment, “that no \\nabortion would take place until October 26.”  \\n  The petition describes a course of events where many different parties \\nwere communicating into the night as events unfolded rapidly. Particularly \\ngiven this fluid situation, and the government’s knowledge that Ms. Doe had \\nsought throughout the litigation to obtain an abortion as soon as possible, it is \\nstriking that government counsel, by the government’s own account, neither \\nrequested that Ms. Doe forbear from obtaining the procedure while the \\ngovernment sought a stay from this Court nor sought confirmation of \\ngovernment counsel’s “understanding” that no abortion would occur prior to \\nOctober 26. Absent such a commitment or confirmation, it was incumbent upon \\ngovernment counsel immediately to seek a stay. The govern ment cannot now \\nblame opposing counsel for its own failure either to act with its customary \\nalacrity or to take any protective steps. \\nIn short, Ms. Doe’s counsel had made clear that they were attempting \\nto help their client obtain the abortion as soon as p ossible; the government \\nknew Ms. Doe had already received counseling from the original doctor, so that \\nif that doctor became available, the abortion could take place immediately; and \\naccording to the government’s own recitation of events, it did not link i ts \\nrequest for information about the timing of Ms. Doe’s appointment on October \\n25 with any statement concerning the timing of a stay motion with this Court. \\n  To suggest that respondent’s counsel had a duty to forbear from \\neffectuating the TRO on October 25 under these facts would turn counsel’s \\nethical obligations on their head. The only reason Ms. Doe’s representatives \\nneeded to talk to government personnel at all was to tell them the timing of \\nMs. Doe’s appointment so that the government would not delay  Ms. Doe’s \\ntransportation to the clinic. If government counsel wished to ensure that they \\nwould have an opportunity to seek a stay before the abortion procedure, they \\ncould and should have requested such an assurance from respondent’s counsel \\nand, if they did not receive a sufficiently clear commitment, they could and \\nshould have immediately sought relief from this Court. They inexplicably \\nfailed to take these reasonable steps, and cannot now blame respondent’s \\ncounsel for the consequences of their own inaction. \\n  In addition to failing to supply a factual basis for its extraordinary \\nrequest, the government fails to supply a specific legal rationale or cite to any \\nlegal authority that supports its position.

With respect to disciplinary action, respondent does not dispute any \\nof the key facts: (i) her counsel indicated to the government and the courts that \\nthe doctor available to Ms. Doe during the week of October 23 was not the \\ndoctor who had provided her prior counseling (and thus the new doctor would \\nhave to wait at least 24 hours after counseling to perform the abortion under \\nTexas law); (ii) Ms. Doe’s representatives expressly told the government that, \\nwhen she did not receive counseling from the new doctor on Tuesday, October \\n24, she would not be able to undergo an abortion until Thursday, October 26; \\n(iii) respondent’s counsel knew that the government was relying on those \\nrepresentations when it delayed seeking emergency relief from this Court \\novernight on October 24; (iv) sometime after the government provided notice \\nof its intent to file on  the morning of October 25, Ms. Doe’s representatives \\nsecured the services of the original doctor; and (v) they made no effort to correct \\ntheir earlier statements. \\n  \\nUnder Rule 8.2, this Court has the authority to “take any appropriate \\ndisciplinary action against any attorney who is admitted to practice before it \\nfor conduct unbecoming a member of the Bar.” That standard is not tied to any \\nState’s ethical code or the Model Rules. Rather, “‘conduct unbecoming a \\nmember of the bar’ is conduct contrary to professional standards that shows an \\nunfitness to discharge continuing obligations to clients or the courts, or conduct \\ninimical to the administration of justice.” If respondent’s counsel knowingly \\nallowed the government to rely on statements that either respondent’s counsel \\nor Ms. Doe’s ad litems deliberately rendered false, such conduct is fairly \\ndescribed as “inimical to the administration of justice.” \\n  \\nThe Model Rules lead to the same conclusion.

Respondent’s \\ncontention both ignores critical facts and is legally irrelevant. First, \\ngovernment counsel asked to be kept informed of the timing of Ms. Doe’s \\nprocedure, and in context the response — “[a]s soon as we understand the \\nclinic’s schedule tomorrow we will let you know”— indicated that respondent’s \\ncounsel would keep the government informed as to the timing of the procedure, \\nnot some mundane fact like what hours the clinic would be open. Second, \\nrespondent does not dispute that Ms. Doe’s attorney ad litem told the \\ngovernment an abortion could not take place until October 26 — a  \\nrepresentation that could not have been clearer. Third, after the government \\ninformed respondent’s counsel of its intentions, one of respondent’s attorneys \\nexpressed relief that he would not need to “check [his] email at 2 a.m.,” \\nconfirming that he knew the government was relying on his co -counsel’s \\nrepresentations about the timing of th e abortion. Even in the absence of a \\n“direct inquiry” from opposing counsel, an attorney’s silence can be equivalent \\nto a misleading statement where it is “obvious that [the opposing party] [i]s \\nacting under a misapprehension,” 2 Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. et al., The Law of \\nLawyering § 40.04, at 40 -13 (2015) (Hazard); see id. § 40.03, at 40 -10, \\nparticularly where it is the attorney’s own conduct  that created the \\nmisimpression. \\n  \\nRespondent insists that her counsel had an obligation “zealously to \\nprotect and pursue [her] legitimate interests” and to maintain client \\nconfidentiality.

To be \\nclear, the government is not arguing that respondent’s counsel had “a duty to \\nforbear from effectuating” the district court’s amend ed TRO as rapidly as \\npossible. Rather, they had a duty not to inform the government (and otherwise \\nlead the government to believe) that the court’s order could not be effectuated \\nbefore October 26; know that the government was relying on those \\nrepresentations; and then actively work to render those representations false \\nin order to prevent this Court’s review. \\n  \\nTo take an analogous example, consider if government counsel informed \\nopposing counsel that the unavailability of a particular drug would prevent the \\ngovernment from carrying out an execution until some future date, but after \\nlearning that the prisoner planned to file an emergency stay application, \\ngovernment counsel undertook extraordinary efforts to obtain the drug and to \\ncarry out the execution sooner without notice to opposing counsel.

But they did not inform government counsel \\nthat the purpose of the appointment had changed from counseling to the \\nabortion itself.

Most of the \\ninformation was release after the SDC ended their representation of Al-\\nNashiri. Some information about the intrusions relating to detainees \\nother than Al-Nashiri and the August 2017 inspection of a room in which \\nAl-Nashiri and his counsel previously met continues to be classified.  \\nIn August 2017, a defense inspection of the room allocated for \\nmeetings between Al-Nashiri and his counsel revealed a microphone or \\nmicrophones that were not connected to recording or transmission \\nequipment. The government referred to the devices as “legacy” \\nmicrophones left over from before 2012 when the building was \\nconfigured for detainee interviews. Thus, Al-Nashiri’s meeting room was \\nequipped with recording equipment. However, the government \\nrepresented to the military judge that when Al-Nashiri met with his \\nSDC, the room included disconnected, legacy microphones that were not \\nconnected to any audio listening/recording device.

As understood by Professor Yaroshefsky, Mr. Kammen was \\nconcerned that (1) the government had intruded into SDC’s privileged \\ncommunications with Al-Nashiri, and (2) SDC lacked confidence that \\nthey could securely communicate with their client, and because of this \\nlack of confidence, SDC were unable to inform Al-Nashiri of these \\nmatters and discuss their concerns with him.  \\nIn addition to the dispute involving “legacy” microphone(s) in the \\nmeeting room where Al-Nashiri met with his counsel, the bases of SDC’s \\nconcerns over the security of their privileged communications with Al -\\nNashiri included a series of events that occurre d between 2008 and \\n2017. Among these events were intrusions or alleged intrusions by the \\ngovernment into the privileged communications of detainees and \\ndefendants at JTF-GTMO. Mr. Kammen summarized the SDC \\ncontentions regarding these matters in a document titled, \\n“Governmental Interference with Attorney-Client Communications, \\nIntrusions into Attorney-Client Relationships, Undisclosed Monitoring, \\nand Infiltration of Defense Teams” (Defense Intrusion Allegations).5  \\n__________ \\nThe Events \\nAfter they found a “legacy” microphone in the interview room, the \\ndefense asked for discovery on the issue; Judge Spath denied the \\nrequest, finding that al-Nashiri’s confidentiality concerns extended only \\nto attorney-client conversations used by the prosecution against him. He \\nalso denied their request for a hearing on the issue, and, finally, he \\ndenied counsels’ request to be able to inform al-Nashiri about their \\nprivacy concerns. Interestingly, in its responses to these motions, the \\ngovernment acknowledged that the room had more microphones than \\nthe one counsel discovered. \\n \\n5 In a 2018 speech to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, General \\nBaker provides further details about these intrusions.

The \\nmilitary judge stated, “[N]o evidence has yet been presented \\nto demonstrate intrusions in this case affecting this \\naccused which would ethically require withdrawal or \\ndisqualification of outside appointed learned counsel.” \\nMoreover, even if there was evidence of an intrusion into \\nAl-Nashiri’s attorney-client relationship, there also must \\nbe evidence of prejudice before relief may be granted.  \\nBefore considering the issue of prejudice, however, there \\nmust first be evidence of an intrusion into the relationship \\nbetween Al-Nashiri and his counsel.

Is this \\na correct understanding of confidentiality? \\n 2.  Under Rule 1.6, Al-Nashiri can waive the right of \\nconfidentiality if he gives informed consent. Richard Kammen states \\nthat, because information about the intrusions is classified, he cannot \\nexplain to Al-Nashiri the basis for his concerns about bugging, and that \\ninformed consent is impossible. If so, can Kammen or other defense \\ncounsel fulfill their obligation of client communication under Rule 1.4? \\n 3.  In the CMCR decision excerpted above, the court states that, \\n“even if there was evidence of an intrusion into Al-Nashiri’s attorney-\\nclient relationship, there also must be evidence of prejudice before relief \\nmay be granted.” The decision cites Fifth and Sixth Amendment cases \\non ineffective assistance of counsel, which do not grant reversal if the \\ndefense was not prejudiced. Is this the correct standard for determining \\nwhether counsel can ethically proceed with a representation?  In other \\nwords: is the constitutional standard the same as the ethical standard? \\n 4.  After Judge Spath ordered Al-Nashiri’s counsel to proceed with \\nthe defense, under threat of contempt of court, was there a conflict of \\ninterest for the lawyers? Under Rule 1.7(a)(2), “a concurrent conflict of \\ninterest exists if there is significant risk that the representation of one \\nor more clients will be materially limited . . . by a personal interest of \\nthe lawyer.” Concurrent representations are prohibited. Will lawyer s \\njudicially coerced into representing a death penalty client be materially \\nlimited by their own personal interest in avoiding punishment ? Judge \\nSpath threatened to have Kammen, Spears, and Eliades arrested. Were \\nthey in a position to stand up to the judge when necessary? \\nClause (b)(1) of Rule 1.7 states that, “notwithstanding the \\nexistence of a concurrent conflict of interest under paragraph (a), a \\nlawyer may represent a client if [among other conditions] the lawyer \\nreasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent \\nand diligent representation to each affected client.” Was that condition \\nfulfilled here? \\n5.  Suppose that substitute counsel were recruited. Could they \\ntake the case under Rule 8.4(a)? \\n6.  Did the learned counsel and Lieutenant Piette have “good \\ncause” for excusal? Did they do the right thing? \\n7.  Judge Spath accused the lawyers of deliberately stalling the \\nslow-moving case.

Spath, however, never disclosed the fact of his \\napplication, much less its details, to Al-Nashiri or to his \\ndefense team. Instead, records obtained through a \\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) request—documents \\nwhose authenticity the government does not dispute—\\nreveal the information we now possess about Spath’s job \\nsearch. . . . \\nSpath submitted his application to an open \\nimmigration judge position in the Executive Office for \\nImmigration Review on November 19, 2015. In his \\napplication, Spath highlighted his “five years of experience \\nas a trial judge,” including that he had been “handpicked” \\nto preside over “the military commissions proceedings for \\nthe alleged ‘Cole bombing’ mastermind”—that is, Al-\\nNashiri—“at Guantanamo Bay.” He also included as a \\nwriting sample an order he issued in Al-Nashiri’s case.15 \\nJudge Spath was notified in 2017 that his application had been accepted, \\nbut a negotiation ensued over the start date.

       " 'Preface \\nIn real-life law practice, ethical issues do not always come neatly \\nboxed and labeled. Often, a representation will raise multiple ethical \\nissues, and as it unfolds over time, additional, perhaps unexpected, \\nconcerns may surface. These issues may be easy to spot or difficult to \\nspot; they may be independent of each other, but they may interact. \\nFacts are often messy and hard to interpret. \\nBy its nature, our textbook treats particular ethical issues in their \\nown chapters—on confidentiality, on conflicts of interest, on client-\\nlawyer relationships, and so forth. A complex multi-issue case study \\nmay straddle several chapters, and for that reason we have assembled \\nthese extended case studies separately from the main text.  \\nThe four case studies presented here are all drawn from actual \\nevents. Each presents multiple ethical issues. Case 1 is a 1982 case, \\nreproduced here with permission of its original authors. The other case \\nstudies are written by the authors of this textbook, and are drawn from \\nrecent high profile cases. In each, we provide extended factual \\nbackground and questions for thought and discussion. \\nAt the beginning of each case study, we provide a brief list of the \\nethics themes that the case raises. This will help instructors decide \\nwhere each case belongs in their syllabus, and it will help students spot \\nthe issues as they read the case study. These lists make it easy to cue \\nthe case studies to the appropriate chapters of the textbook, as we do in \\nthis Preface. Some of the cases appear in the textbook itself, in much-\\nabbreviated form. \\nWe do not expect that instructors will wish to use all four case \\nstudies; each takes at least half a classroom hour to discuss properly. At \\nthe same time, we think they enhance learning, and using one or more \\nof them in the semester will diversify the course, and hopefully make it \\nmore interesting. We believe that the best way to use these case studies \\nis to divide students into small groups to work through their approach \\nto the cases together, either in advance of class or during class. \\nThe four case studies are as follows: \\nCase Study 1 (Rita’s Case), appeared in the textbook in earlier \\neditions. It involves legal aid lawyers in Philadelphia whose client is a \\ngrandmother raising her somewhat troubled granddaughter “Rita,” as \\nsocial services try to place Rita with foster parents. It raises issues about \\nthe lawyers’ appropriate role and style of lawyering, and thus it pairs \\nwith themes in Chapter 4. But it also contains difficult issues of client-\\n1',\n",
       " 'lawyer relationships (Chapter 5), confidentiality (Chapter 6), conflicts of \\ninterest (Chapter 9), and public interest law practice (Chapter 14).  \\nCase Study 2 (David Boies’s Work for Harvey Weinstein in \\n#MeToo) is a well-known case in which “superlawyer” David Boies, \\nrepresenting movie mogul and sexual predator Weinstein, hired a \\nprivate espionage firm to find out from reporters the names of women \\nwho intended to go public with accusations against him. This included \\nreporters for the New York Times, which Boies’s firm was representing \\nin unrelated matters. The espionage firm used “pretexting” \\n(impersonation) as a technique for engaging with reporters. After the \\nWeinstein scandal and the beginnings of the #MeToo movement, Boies \\nmade public comments critical of his client. The case raises questions \\nabout choice of clients (Chapter 4), client loyalty and allocation of \\ndecision-making (Chapter 5), the no-contact rule and attorney-client \\nprivilege (Chapter 6), conflicts of interest and advance waivers of \\nconflicts (Chapter 9), the duties of supervisory lawyers (Chapter 11), and \\nissues of honesty and deceit. \\nCase Study 3 (ACLU Counsel Representing an Undocumented \\nMinor Seeking an Abortion)  is based on the facts underlying the \\nSupreme Court’s 2018 case Azar v. Garza . Here, the Solicitor General \\nasked the Supreme Court to impose disciplinary sanctions against \\nACLU counsel for allegedly deceiving the government in a dramatic and \\ncontentious case involving an undocumented minor seeking an abortion. \\nHer counsel did not inform DOJ lawyers that their client would receive \\nan abortion sooner than the two sides originally anticipated; as a result, \\nthe government failed to file a timely motion for a stay. The SG claimed \\nthat this conduct constituted fraud by omission. However, the Supreme \\nCourt chose to duck the issue. The case study is document-based: it \\nincludes excerpts from the dueling briefs, along with relevant legal \\nstandards, and it asks readers to address the issue the Court failed to \\nresolve. Here, the principal question is whether, in highly contentious \\nlitigation, true but incomplete statements to the adversary constitute \\nfraud by omission. This requires analyzing Model Rule 4.1, but it also \\nraises issues of confidentiality and its exceptions (Chapter 6).

       " 'Harvard Program on the Legal Profession, Philadelphia Legal \\nAid:  \\nRita’s Case* \\n(1982) \\nJoan Kiladis sat down in her office to draft a letter to her client, \\nGladys A., which would close the file dealing with the custody dispute \\nover Gladys’s granddaughter Rita. It was April 14, 1982, and the case \\nhad been opened over three years ago, in March, 1979. It had been a long \\nand drawn out process, but the closing letter would indicate that Joan \\nKiladis and Keith Maynard, the two Philadelphia Legal Aid attorneys \\nwho had worked on the case, had obtained their objective—Gladys A. \\nhad been able to adopt her granddaughter over the initial objection of \\nthe Department of Public Welfare. Nonetheless, Kiladis wondered if \\nthere was another issue that should be pursued before this case was put \\nto rest. That issue was the allegation of sexual abuse which had \\nprecipitated Rita’s custody dispute. Although Kiladis was convinced \\nthat the alleged sex abuse suffered by the child had been real, she was \\nless sure whether or not the matter should be pursued. She decided to \\ndiscuss it with Maynard, a poverty lawyer of many years’ experience. \\nKiladis herself, although 40 years old and experienced as a draft \\ncounselor and mother of two, was just two years out of law school—more \\nrecently than the origin of the case itself—and had never encountered \\nan issue as complex as this one. \\nAt Maynard’s office, Kiladis broached the problem with him. It \\nwas not the first time. In fact, Kiladis and Maynard had had a running \\nargument for over a year about whether or not to sue the Children’s \\nHome, in which Rita had resided for many years, for sexual abuse. \\nKiladis went in to argue her position one more time. As she had known \\nhe would, Maynard refused to turn to the specifics of the allegation until \\nhe had reminded both of them of the way the whole system worked when \\nthe custody of a child was at stake. \\n“No one in the system wants to take responsibility for the final \\ndecision about the placement of a child, so there is always a shifting of \\nthat responsibility, and in the final analysis there is no independent \\nadjudication on any issue,” said Maynard. He had learned, over the \\nyears, to use that aspect of the system to his clients’ advantage. In \\nessence, Maynard believed that attorneys created the history of a case \\n \\n* This case was prepared by Leila R.

       " 'for presentation to a judge by selectively emphasizing and investigating \\ncertain events and injuries and letting others fade. They manipulated \\nthe other professionals (such as social workers and physicians) involved \\nin the case, and utilized their strengths and weaknesses to the client’s \\nadvantage. Often, whether knowingly or unknowingly, they steered \\nclients’ choices to take advantage of these very efforts. Maynard \\nreminded Kiladis that she had come into the case one and one half years \\nafter he did and was therefore reacting in part to the scenario that he \\nhad created in the file and in the case. Additionally, he pointed out, \\nKiladis had become very personally involved with Gladys, the child, and \\nmany other members of the family. Although this interest had helped to \\nwin the case for Gladys, both of these factors, in Maynard’s opinion, \\naffected Kiladis’s judgment and objectivity. The two attorneys agreed to \\nlook over the files together, one more time, before deciding how to \\nproceed. \\nRita’s Background \\nRita was born in Bellevue Hospital in New York City in December \\nof 1971. Her mother, Carlota, had entered the hospital, in labor, just \\nfour hours after taking a shot of heroin. Rita’s father, who had been \\nliving with Carlota for a number of years and who had fathered her two \\nother children, was not present, nor was his name entered on Rita’s birth \\ncertificate. Carlota abandoned Rita in the hospital, where the infant \\nremained for three months, being treated for both heroin addiction and \\nsyphilis. Her maternal grandmother, Gladys, obtained legal \\nguardianship and took Rita home in March of 1972. \\nRita lived with her grandmother for the next two and one half \\nyears. First they resided in New York City; then, with the New York \\ncourt’s approval, they moved to West Philadelphia where they lived in a \\nhouse next door to a low-income public housing project. Although many \\nmembers of the family—aunts, uncles, cousins—also lived with Gladys \\nat various times during this period, two others were more permanent \\nmembers of the household, both in New York and in Philadelphia. One \\nwas Manuel, Rita’s first cousin. Three years older than Rita, Manuel \\nhad also been born out-of-wedlock, to Rita’s aunt, Maria, and had been \\nraised by Gladys from birth. Maria, like her sister Carlota, was addicted \\nto heroin. The second semi-permanent member of the household, Juan, \\nwas to become Rita’s step-grandfather. Born in 1950, Juan had been \\nbrought up by Gladys since he was 15. He became her third husband in \\n1977, when he was 27 and Gladys was about 51. \\nIn August 1974 Gladys turned to the Department of Public \\nWelfare (DPW) in Philadelphia for help with Rita. The child, although \\nonly two and one half years old, was very difficult to handle; according \\nto Gladys, she had become manipulative, aggressive and generally \\n7',\n",
       " 'unmanageable. Gladys was scheduled for gall bladder surgery and \\nneeded help caring for Rita. The department suggested that Gladys \\nplace Rita in the Catholic Home for Children where the child could be \\nevaluated and receive appropriate therapy, if needed. The Home \\nrequested that St. Christopher’s Hospital evaluate Rita, and then the \\nHome began therapy while Rita resided there. \\nDuring the period from August 1974 until June 1976 Rita seemed \\nto thrive in this placement. She visited her family frequently on \\nweekends, and her grandmother was often at the Home during the week \\nas well. Gladys viewed the Catholic Home as a temporary residential \\nfacility where children could receive help. The DPW, however, often \\nused the Home as a clearinghouse for children needing foster care. In \\nfact, in June 1976 the Home decided to place Rita with a foster family \\nin Germantown, a lower-middle -class Philadelphia suburb. Gladys \\ncontinued to visit Rita and take her home on weekends, during the next \\nseven months that Rita lived in Germantown. Relations between Gladys \\nand Rita’s foster family quickly became strained. The foster parents \\ncomplained to the Home that Gladys was not sticking to the visitation \\nschedule, and Gladys complained to DPW that Rita’s foster parents were \\nabusing her. Acting on these latter reports, DPW removed Rita from the \\nfoster family and returned her to her grandmother. By this time, \\nFebruary 1977, Juan and Gladys had married. \\nFour months later, Gladys turned once again to DPW. Gladys had \\nbeen receiving counseling from a social worker, Elizabeth Reilly, who \\nhad encouraged her to seek help with Rita. Gladys was depressed, and \\nthe child was still aggressive and difficult, biting other children and \\nthrowing temper tantrums. Again DPW placed Rita in the Catholic \\nHome for Children. During the following 18 months, Rita again settled \\ninto the routine at the Home, and again the Home moved toward a foster \\nplacement. Although there were still many home visits, Gladys was \\nhaving more difficulty maintaining the visiting schedule. She often did \\nnot arrive when she had promised to do so, and she often left early. \\nOccasionally, Rita’s mother, who had also moved to Philadelphia, visited \\nher at the Home. Home personnel noted that Rita often returned from \\nvisits to Gladys appearing distressed. \\nThe move toward placing Rita in a foster home was greatly \\naccelerated in January of 1979. For two months, Rita had been in play \\ntherapy with a young psychology student who had become increasingly \\nalarmed by the child’s apparent sexual sophistication. Rita was then \\nseven years of age. The student believed that Rita was acting out, in \\ntherapy, some experience of sexual seduction or observation of sexual \\nbehavior. The student, and her supervisor—who was studying sexually \\nabused children—concurred that Rita had had such experiences and \\n8',\n",
       " 'that they must have occurred in Gladys’s home, or at the least when \\nRita was in Gladys’s care. Suspecting Juan, Rita’s step-grandfather, the \\nHome filed a Form CY47 report of possible abuse with DPW. Rita was \\nthen moved to a foster placement with a middle-class family in \\nJenkintown, a well-to-do distant suburb of Philadelphia about 20 miles \\nfrom Gladys’s home in West Philadelphia. Gladys was given neither \\nRita’s address nor her phone number. \\nGladys turned for help to her social worker, who contacted \\nPhiladelphia Legal Aid (PLA) and asked Maynard to intercede on \\nGladys’s behalf. DPW was about to file a motion for protective custody \\nof Rita and a motion to dispense with Rita’s mother’s consent to Rita’s \\nadoption by the foster family in Jenkintown. It was DPW’s position that \\nGladys, as grandmother, had no standing to intervene. \\nThe legal battle began in the spring of 1979 and resulted, first, in \\nestablishing a pattern of visitation between Rita and Gladys, agreed to \\nby the parties; next, in the return of Rita to live with Gladys in March \\n1981; and finally in the adoption of Rita by Gladys and Juan in April \\n1982. By then Gladys and Juan were living separately. In the interim \\nboth Maynard and Kiladis at PLA had become involved with the case; \\nthe court had appointed an attorney, David Slade, an associate at a \\nsmall downtown law firm, to represent Rita; there had been a complete \\nchange in DPW personnel dealing with the case and with the family; \\nand St. Christopher’s had done two court-ordered psychological \\nevaluations of Rita and her grandparents, to be paid for by the county. \\nLawyers’ Views \\nLooking back over their files on Rita, Maynard and Kiladis noted \\nthe legal issues that had punctuated the child’s short but complex life. \\nThere had been prolonged guardianship hearings while Rita was still a \\npatient in the Bellevue nursery in New York, which had continued after \\nRita went to live with Gladys. Kiladis remarked: \\nThe result was, when Carlota—Rita’s mother—\\nrealized that she was going to lose all of her children, she \\nactually got herself on methadone. And, although there \\nwere lapses, she was eventually given her older two \\nchildren back, with enormous supervision. She had also \\ncome to Pennsylvania. I’m not sure whether legally or not. \\nBut she seemed to be doing a reasonably good job with the \\nolder children. \\nIt was not clear why Gladys had been named guardian, since \\ngrandparents had no special status in guardianship cases, and certain \\nfactors in Gladys’s home life seemed to argue against court-ordered \\n9',\n",
       " 'guardianship. Maynard guessed that some social worker had filed the \\nnecessary papers and pushed the guardianship through. \\nWhen Gladys contacted DPW in August 1974, her feelings toward \\nRita seemed to Maynard to indicate ambivalence, “Gladys loves Rita, \\nalso can’t control her, is somewhat older and not feeling well. There is \\nthis, ‘I want her away, I want her back.’  ” As soon as her surgery was \\nscheduled, she sought help in coping with the child. Maynard observed: \\nThe puzzle here is why, between ’74 and ’76, Gladys, \\nwhen she finished her gall bladder operation, did not bring \\nRita home. I think this is where the ambivalence \\nmanifests. That is, once Gladys got home, and a period of \\ntime passed as she recovered from major surgery, she \\nfound she had a situation that was not so bad. So Gladys \\nleft things alone; in the same way, I think, that some \\nparents in other class settings who are ambivalent about \\ntheir children, have their children in boarding school. \\nBut Gladys couldn’t adapt to the “boarding school” regime; she \\ncouldn’t adapt to the rules. “I think the Home found Gladys to be a pain \\nin the ass,” added Maynard. She couldn’t do anything on time. She came \\nto visit Rita during the week, she baked birthday cakes for other \\nchildren’s birthdays and came with those. She often brought Rita back \\nlate after a weekend home visit. Sometimes after such visits Rita’s face \\nand clothes were dirty and her hair uncombed, which shocked Home \\npersonnel. The Home staff, accordingly, decided that Rita would be \\nbetter off in foster care and placed her in Germantown. This decision \\nwas reinforced by the fact that they didn’t get a clear statement from \\nGladys that she wanted Rita back before they placed her. Afterwards, \\nhowever, Glady’s interest in Rita’s return increased enormously. \\nMaynard mused: \\nI believe that Gladys intentionally undermined this \\nplacement. She was extremely threatened that she had \\nfailed as a mother again, and that she was going to lose \\nRita permanently. Gladys did not have the ability to \\ndirectly say to the Home, “I want my child back.” So, I think \\nshe made it very difficult for the foster family. When she \\ntalked to Rita about it, Rita picked up signals about what \\nGladys wanted to hear. So Rita started saying things about \\nwhat was being done to her. You couldn’t really tell \\nwhether they were true or not. \\nKiladis, however, was more convinced of the truth of Rita’s \\ncomplaints. She recalled that Rita related to her, almost four years after \\nthat first placement, an incident in which the foster father had given \\n10',\n",
       " 'her a severe beating for not doing a dance of some kind. Gladys had \\ncorroborated this tale with a description of bruises on Rita’s buttocks, \\nback and sides. It was at that time that Gladys finally complained to the \\nDPW social worker, and he had Rita returned to Gladys within three \\ndays. Kiladis added, “I suspect that that really is the fastest the DPW \\nworks.” \\nThe PLA lawyers recalled that, at first, everything seemed fine \\nwhen Rita returned to Gladys. But soon it became clear that Rita was \\nstill a very difficult child. Gladys became very depressed. She couldn’t \\nhandle Rita at all, and something seemed to be wrong with the child. \\nGladys turned to a social worker therapist, Elizabeth Reilly, and had \\nRita evaluated at the Learning Disabilities Center where Reilly worked. \\nReilly not only convinced Gladys to place Rita back at the Home, but she \\nalso began a process of convincing Gladys to put Rita up for adoption. \\nAccording to Maynard: \\nIt was not very long into therapy that Elizabeth \\nReilly said to herself, “This is a woman with extreme \\nemotional problems, not sick, but with emotional problems; \\nand she has a very complicated relationship with a young \\nman. She is having some trouble raising one child—\\nManuel; she is having a lot of difficulty with Rita, who \\nseems to be a disturbed child. Gladys can’t cope. This is not \\ngood for Rita, this is not good for Gladys, so let’s move for \\nadoption.” \\nBut Reilly was not totally open with Gladys, who seemed to \\nbelieve that Rita’s placement in the Home was again temporary; that \\nthe Home would provide treatment for Rita; that she would visit often \\nand bring Rita home on weekends; and, eventually, perhaps when Rita \\nimproved, would bring her home again. \\nMaynard recalled that now Gladys’s visits took on a different kind \\nof irregularity. Gladys would say that she was coming on Sunday and \\nthen show up on Monday; she would say “I’m coming at noon” and then \\nshow up at 6:00 P.M. During Rita’s first stay at the Home, Gladys had \\nbeen late in bringing her back; now she was often late picking her up. \\nThe records from the Home’s logs indicated that Rita often returned to \\nthe Home upset and even had difficulty sleeping on some occasions after \\na home visit. Kiladis felt that Rita was being torn between her life with \\nGladys and her life at the Home. Many of the rules were different, and \\nshe speculated that Rita must have struggled with Gladys’s disapproval \\nof many of the practices at the Home. An example, recalled by Kiladis, \\nwas Gladys’s anger and concern that Rita was permitted to sleep in a \\nnightgown without panties, and to sleep in the same room as the boys \\nin her cottage. At the same time, a nun at the Home had expressed \\n11',\n",
       " 'concern that Rita was allowed to get into bed with Gladys to watch \\ntelevision. \\nWithin a year of Rita’s return to the Home, plans were again \\nmade to move Rita to a foster family. Maynard remarked: \\nThe planning came from the judgments of the people \\nat the Home that Rita really ought to be permanently  \\nplaced somewhere, and that Grandma should remain \\nGrandma. There should be visits, but Rita should slowly be \\nweaned away from her Grandmother. This was a judgment \\nthat was concurred in by Elizabeth Reilly, Gladys’s \\ntherapist. And there was something in writing, some \\ndocument from the Home that indicated consent by Gladys \\nto an adoption. Interestingly enough, when we got \\ndiscovery that document was missing; but I had seen it. \\nBut the plans to move Rita into a foster placement were greatly \\naccelerated when the young, inexperienced psychology student, after six \\nplay-therapy sessions with Rita, concluded that Rita had been sexually \\nabused. Kiladis commented: \\nThe student was being supervised by someone whose \\n“thing” was sexual abuse. What wasn’t so clear to us and \\ntook us a while to find out was that half of the children in \\nthe Home had been placed there as a result of being \\nsexually abused. This student felt that Rita was acting out \\nvarious sexual behaviors. What was somewhat unfair \\nabout it, was that—apparently—this went on all the time. \\nKids, often, playacted partly as a way of working through \\nsome of what they’ve been through, and obviously it rubbed \\noff on some of the other kids. But this student really \\nfreaked out about what was going on. \\nAlthough it was quite possible that Rita had been exposed to some \\nsexual behavior, it was not clear exactly what had occurred or where. \\nThe Home immediately directed suspicion at Juan and decided to place \\nRita out of Gladys’s reach. Although formally the reason for cutting off \\nvisitation was the sexual abuse question, Maynard believed that what \\nwas lurking in the background was Gladys’s failure to cooperate with \\nthe first foster placement. “All of the social workers’ notes were loaded \\nwith things like that, that Gladys was and had continuously been \\ndifficult.” \\nThe Home’s inappropriate promise to Rita’s new foster parents in \\nJenkintown, the Biancos, that the child was definitely theirs to adopt \\ncomplicated matters further. Kiladis felt that this promise might have \\nbeen part of “a deliberate cover-up” of Rita’s exposure to either sexual \\n12',\n",
       " 'abuse or sexual activity at the Home itself. At first Gladys had reacted \\npassively to Rita’s placement in a foster home, as she had when Rita was \\nplaced in Germantown the first time. But when the new DPW worker \\non the case, Mary Nota, who had met Gladys only once before, bluntly \\ntold her that Rita was being placed a second time, adding “I’m not going \\nto let you see her,” and furthermore made accusations about sexual \\nabuse of Rita by Juan, Gladys’s attitude suddenly altered. Maynard \\nrecalled: “Gladys went back to Reilly and her staff and drove them crazy, \\nscreaming at them, ‘You’ve got to help me!’ and they in turn called us.” \\nMaynard added: \\nI got a call from them saying that we had to help this \\nwoman. There had been accusations of sexual abuse and \\nher child had been taken away. They didn’t say anything \\nto me about the fact that they had been moving Gladys \\ntoward adoption, that they themselves felt that that might \\nbe both in Gladys and Rita’s best interests. I learned of \\nthese things only after the case came to us. \\nIn a complicated series of moves (see legal strategy below) \\nMaynard was able to negotiate a visitation schedule while Rita was \\nbeing evaluated by a group of specialists at St. Christopher’s, who dealt \\nwith child and sex abuse victims. After several weeks, however, the \\n“games began again,” as Kiladis put it. She commented that Gladys and \\nthe Biancos competed for Rita like divorcing parents. Gladys was never \\non time bringing back Rita and never returned her to the Biancos in the \\nsame clothes in which she had left. The Biancos often dressed her \\ninappropriately—for example, dressing her in a party dress when they \\nknew that Gladys was taking Rita on a picnic. The Biancos would then \\ncomplain when Rita’s dress became soiled. Each family criticized the \\nother’s way of life. The Biancos were not Hispanic, and Jenkintown had \\nessentially no Hispanic population. Rita, who had been bilingual, could \\nno longer speak much Spanish. In fact, the Biancos severely \\nreprimanded her for any tendencies to use Spanish. At school in \\nJenkintown she was exposed to racial slurs and made to feel very \\ninferior for being Spanish. Kiladis recalled that Rita had told her that \\nthe Biancos said, “If you go back to West Philadelphia you will become \\nscum like the rest of them, but we have this wonderful suburban \\nlifestyle.” The attorneys began to believe that the situation in \\nJenkintown was so bad that returning Rita to Gladys seemed to be a \\nrelatively better course. They were concerned that Rita was losing her \\nidentity as an Hispanic, and that if Rita were not returned to the \\nHispanic community, her ethnic roots would be irreversibly lost. \\nBy the time Kiladis entered the case, Maynard had gotten to know \\nGladys well. He didn’t believe for one minute that there was sexual \\n13',\n",
       " 'abuse in Gladys’s home. He also believed that losing Rita permanently \\nwould be a terrible blow for her. If, during the course of the prolonged \\nlegal maneuverings, Gladys’s anger and anxiety had dissipated and she \\nhad become able once again to consider adoption as in Rita’s best \\ninterests, Maynard would have been amenable. But by the time he had \\nobtained all the information he needed to represent Gladys, the \\nsituation had been reshaped by the judicial process itself. \\nHe had begun his interviewing of the various professionals \\ninvolved knowing that by the time there was a decision about what \\nmight be best for Rita, that decision might not look the same as it would \\nhave on the day he began. Appraising his feelings at the time, Maynard \\ncommented: \\nInvariably I begin investigating these sorts of cases \\nas if the facts are there to be assembled for decision at some \\nfuture date. But, on the ground that then we will make a \\ndecision, in my gut, I know that the decision is not going to \\nbe the same once the investigation is completed. Memories, \\nperceptions and positions will all have been affected, \\ninfluenced by the investigation itself. What might have \\nlooked very bad for a client before a lawyer gets into a case \\ncan look very different after the lawyer’s influence is felt. \\nOn the other hand, what are the choices? This is not an \\nextreme case where I suspected that the child was being \\nabused by my client. I did suspect, and this turned out to \\nbe true, that Rita’s mother was involved much more than \\nGladys was telling us. Rita had Carlota’s phone number \\nand often spoke with her, and Carlota was often at Gladys’s \\nhouse. In addition, Rita went over to her mother’s house \\nmore often than any of us had realized, and the exposures \\nover there that would be bad for a child were enormous. \\nBut this wasn’t enough to alter what I did in the case. I \\nsimply chose the right of Gladys to make the decision about \\nher grandchild, over other people. I did not decide that I \\nwas the lawyer to the whole situation to decide what was \\nbest for Rita. Within certain limits, I really did and do allow \\nmy role as an advocate in the situation to take its course. \\nKiladis’ approach to this was somewhat different. Kiladis had let \\nMaynard know, when she first became involved with the case, that she \\nhad to speak with Rita before she made a commitment to represent \\nGladys. If DPW were correct in its evaluation of the situation and if Rita \\nhad developed a strong positive bond with the Biancos, then Kiladis felt \\nshe would not have “the emotional energy for the case.” But if Rita \\nreported that life with the Biancos was very different from the way both \\n14',\n",
       " 'the Home and DPW described it, then “it would be very important to \\nhelp her.” Kiladis recalled: \\nUltimately, it put me in a bit of a bind. It wasn’t clear \\nwhose attorney I was; what I was advocating for, and so on. \\nKnowing Rita’s needs as well as Gladys’s and eventually \\neven Carlota’s created a lot of tension for me. Their needs \\nwere different and it was not clear how to bargain them \\nout; whether to try to get the maximum good for everyone \\nor just for our client, Gladys. \\nAside from the question of what might or might not be in Rita’s \\nbest interests, Maynard had first been confronted with the problem of \\nGladys’s best interests. For Maynard, that issue had two distinct parts. \\nFirst, Gladys wanted Maynard to move immediately to get Rita back for \\nher. Here Maynard had two concerns: first, that he might lose in court \\nif he had to go in at a time when suspicions of sexual abuse were being \\nraised, and, second, that a court battle would take its toll on Gladys \\nherself. At the outset Gladys was not emotionally capable of \\nwithstanding the upheaval of a prolonged court procedure. Early in the \\ncase Maynard had come to realize that it would be extremely painful for \\nGladys to confront an outside observer’s evaluation of her fitness for \\nparenthood. \\nGladys’s one emotional peg was her therapist, Reilly. It was Reilly \\nwho had called Maynard and implored him to represent Gladys against \\nDPW. Yet it was also Reilly who believed that Rita should be adopted; if \\nDPW called her at trial, she would make a damning expert witness \\nagainst Gladys. In fact, at the beginning there had been no expert \\nwitnesses available who could make a favorable presentation. Maynard \\nbelieved that Reilly had, as he put it, “screwed Gladys” by not being \\nhonest with her about the therapist’s concerns, both that Rita was being \\nexposed to a drug-dominated environment through continued contacts \\nwith Carlota and that Gladys was too depressed to cope with the \\nsituation. He had insisted, after speaking with Reilly, that she become \\nmore honest with Gladys and that he was not going to be the one to go \\nback and tell Gladys what the therapist’s position actually was. \\nMaynard felt obligated both to tell his clients everything he \\ndiscovered and at the same time to protect them. Although he intended \\nto be Gladys’s advocate and try to intervene with DPW, his legal \\ninstincts told him he could best manage the case by drawing things out \\nfor quite a while despite Gladys’s desire to act immediately. Maynard \\ntherefore decided that it did not make sense to force the issue to a \\nhearing right away: \\n15',\n",
       " 'One, I couldn’t win. Two, I thought this would be bad \\nfor Gladys. And three, the expert who had been doing \\ntherapy all of this time could not make a good witness for \\nGladys. So I went back to Gladys and I said: “I don’t think \\nthat I can win it now. I don’t think I can even get you \\nvisitation now, although if you tell me that I have to, I will \\ntry. I also don’t think that Elizabeth Reilly will be as good \\na witness for you as she needs to be. I have got to do a lot \\nof work with her, and you should start talking to her as \\nwell.” . . . Of course she accepted it, the way she accepts all \\nauthorities, in a passive/aggressive manner. But I \\nconfronted her with that also. We talked about her anger \\nwith me and her inability to challenge me. I think we did \\nso in a healthy way, but long after the initial decision to \\nwait had been made. \\nLegal Strategy \\nThe first official action taken by Maynard as Gladys’s lawyer was \\na letter which he wrote for her on May 10, 1979, more than two months \\nafter she came to him. Essentially the letter was a statement from \\nGladys that she wished to terminate DPW’s custody of Rita, and it \\nincluded a demand that Rita be returned to her. Maynard knew that \\nthis would precipitate action on the part of the department, and it did. \\nBut by then Maynard had begun the process he described as “obtaining \\ninformation from, and trying to neutralize,” the professionals involved \\nin the case, and he was ready to proceed. In the March through May \\nperiod, Maynard had constantly asked for visits at critical times: a \\nconfirmation ceremony in the family, illness of a close relative, a whole \\nrange of similar events. Each time, the visits were refused. There was \\nconstant negotiation with DPW about visits. The Department’s hard-\\nline position was later brought up by Maynard in conversations with St. \\nChristopher’s and with David Slade, whom the court had appointed as \\nRita’s attorney on June 11, 1979. In addition, the staff at PLA had begun \\nto see every person involved in the case. The legal docket in Philadelphia \\nCounty Probate Court indicates that the DPW moved for temporary \\ncustody of Rita on May 25, 1979, and that that motion was allowed by \\nJudge Warren. \\nOn June 8, 1979, Maynard filed two motions: one for visitation \\nand one for the payment of expert assistance for a psychological \\nevaluation. When they went into court on the 11th of June, Maynard did \\nnot press the first motion. Instead he again negotiated with DPW about \\nthe visitation issue: \\nWhat I said to them was that Gladys should be \\nallowed to visit. I asked them why they felt that she \\n16',\n",
       " 'shouldn’t. They told me that it was too dangerous, that \\nGladys, or someone in her household, was going to sexually \\nabuse the child. Then I brought up the notion of having an \\nindependent expert decide the issue. I used the two \\nmotions to get them to concede to the motion for expert \\nassistance. \\nIn fact, the visitation motion was never acted on in court; \\nMaynard continued to pursue that goal through negotiation. On the \\nother hand, Judge Warren allowed the motion for payment of expert \\nassistance, given that DPW did not oppose it. Had the department \\nopposed it at that time, Maynard believed that he still might have been \\nable to prevail, but he couldn’t be sure, given the costs it imposed on the \\ncounty. Instead, everybody agreed that expert assistance was a good \\nidea; that Gladys really couldn’t afford it, that it should be provided and, \\nmoreover, that it should be provided by the team of specialists at St. \\nChristopher’s. Maynard’s choice of that team was a deliberate one: \\nBefore I went on the motion, I went to St. \\nChristopher’s. I had two meetings with the people there. \\nThey had never seen Gladys, but I had two meetings with \\nthem. I had a long talk with them about what I saw was \\ngoing on and about how important it was that they look \\ninto it. I also went to see the fellow who runs the clinic, \\nknowing that at that time St. Christopher’s was involved \\nin an internal struggle over whether to support DPW’s \\napproach to child custody issues, an approach which many \\nsaw as extreme intervention. \\nMaynard felt that many of the specialists on the team at St. \\nChristopher’s had attitudes that were ideal for his client. They were \\ninternally involved in a fight about whether they should be supportive \\nof DPW’s approach to removing children from their homes; they were \\nsympathetic to poor people; they didn’t respect social workers (who \\ngenerally stood at the bottom of the hierarchy of mental health \\nprofessionals); and they believed that the social workers’ decisions were \\noften ill-advised and unsympathetic to poor people. Maynard recalled, “I \\nknew they would bend over backwards to be non-interventionist in a \\ncase with PLA; I knew they would take the general position that these \\nkids belong at home.” In this particular case, where a child was being \\ntaken from an Hispanic environment and being removed to a distant \\nsuburb where she was not being allowed to see her relatives, Maynard \\nthought the team would surely begin with an attitude biased in favor of \\nGladys. By the time Maynard had met with them twice, he knew that \\nhe had a “fairly receptive audience.” \\n17',\n",
       " 'Maynard told Judge Warren that he had been to see the people at \\nSt. Christopher’s, and had talked with them. He indicated that they \\nwould be willing to accept the appointment from the court. Maynard was \\nrelieved that neither Slade nor the DPW counsel objected to the choice \\nof St. Christopher’s as evaluator. Had he been on the other side, \\nMaynard noted, he would have demanded a different appointment, \\nrecognizing that the attorney who got to the expert first established a \\nrelationship which invariably sets up the case to some extent in his \\nfavor. But, in Maynard’s words, “They were so relieved to give up this \\nfight on visitation for a period of time that they went along with the \\nappointment of St. Christopher’s as an evaluator.” \\nIt was not until August of 1980 that Slade voiced some concern \\nabout the evaluation being done by St. Christopher’s. At that time he \\nmoved for an additional psychological evaluation and payment of costs. \\nAlthough this evaluation was also to be conducted by St. Christopher’s, \\nSlade specified that the report evaluate Gladys’s household as a \\npotential home for Rita rather than limiting itself to the question of \\nwhether or not abuse had occurred there. Although Maynard knew that \\nSlade might have realized that the St. Christopher’s team was going \\nover to Gladys’s side, Maynard went along with the motion for a new \\nevaluation because “I knew we had St. Christopher’s; once you’ve got \\nthem that far, you’ve got them.” \\nThe entire evaluation process was very drawn out. But that also, \\nMaynard thought, worked in Gladys’s favor in the long run. In the \\ninterim, the PLA attorneys were able to build up visitation, bit by bit; \\nthey saw Rita’s therapist in Jenkintown, the nun at the Home, the DPW \\nsocial workers, and Gladys’s therapist, Reilly. Every interview had a \\ndual purpose: it was an opportunity to get information and an \\nopportunity to in some way “neutralize” the speaker to ensure his or her \\npassive acquiescence in (if not active support for) a result which favored \\nGladys. Maynard commented that “all of those contacts were \\nnegotiations as well as interviews. The whole strategy was to bring the \\nprofessionals around so that they saw Rita’s placement as something \\nthat ought to change.” \\nMaynard knew that Gladys’s standing to intervene with DPW’s \\nattempts to gain custody of Rita might be c hallenged. Grandparents, \\nunlike parents, had no special status in custody cases, and Maynard was \\nconcerned about the legality in Pennsylvania of a guardianship \\nauthorized by New York. He had asked students and others at PLA to \\nresearch the issue, but there seemed to be no law on it. Maynard treated \\nGladys as if she were a substitute mother, but he knew that that status \\nwas not clear legally. By the end of the case, the DPW counsel and \\neveryone else involved was referring to Gladys as Rita’s legal guardian, \\n18',\n",
       " 'and pointing to the New York court’s order for authority. In February \\n1981, PLA filed the New York guardianship records, but Kiladis \\nrecalled, “I was reluctant to bring up the issue of Gladys’s guardianship \\nfrom New York because I had researched that and I knew how flimsy it \\nwas.” \\nAccording to Maynard, the DPW social worker on the case when \\nRita was first placed with the Biancos, Mary Nota, had not only bungled \\nrelations with Gladys when the move was made, but also had difficulty \\nmanaging an adversarial relationship with PLA. He recalled he was able \\nto take advantage of Nota’s mistakes: “We worked on Mary Nota to the \\npoint where she was so angry with us that she made a terrible witness \\nat St. Christopher’s. All she did was rant and rave about us and not talk \\nabout Rita.” Maynard deliberately did nothing to decrease Nota’s \\nvindictiveness nor to improve her relationship with Gladys. Kiladis had \\nalso seriously questioned Nota’s choice of Betty Bianco as a foster \\nmother. Betty was known as someone who became very attached to the \\nchildren placed with her, and then was very upset when any one of them \\nleft. This bonding, in Kiladis’s opinion, was certain to exacerbate the \\nrelationship between Betty and Gladys. Both women were fighting to be \\nRita’s mother. \\nDuring this period, there were many personnel shifts at DPW; \\namong them, the replacement of Mary Nota by Margaret Kamin. Kiladis \\nand Maynard both perceived this change to be a very beneficial one for \\ntheir client. People from PLA were in Kamin’s office within a week after \\nshe started, talking to her about the situation from their point of view. \\nMaynard recalled that Kamin wasn’t completely taken in by this \\nstrategy, but she was willing to give the case a fresh look. \\nA great deal had changed under the influence of PLA. A schedule \\nof day visits had been established. The St. Christopher’s team was \\nevaluating the situation, and though Gladys was cooperating fully with \\nthem, Betty Bianco was not. Because Betty refused to bring Rita in to \\nPhiladelphia to go to St. Christopher’s, Joan Kiladis and then Margaret \\nKamin, were driving out to Jenkintown to pick up Rita and bring her \\ndowntown. Gladys was still in therapy with Elizabeth Reilly, whom \\nMaynard felt he had “turned around.” \\nThe team at St. Christopher’s was aware that Rita was feeling a \\ngreat deal of tension because of the racism in the Jenkintown school she \\nwas attending. By March 1980 a talk between Gladys’s attorneys and \\nthe staff at St. Christopher’s indicated that they were coming to three \\nconclusions, summarized in a memo in the PLA file: \\n(1) While the St. Christopher’s team cannot state \\ncategorically that there has been no sexual abuse, nothing \\n19',\n",
       " 'in Rita’s language or behavior indicates any basis for the \\nCY47. If she was abused, she is no longer cognizant of the \\nfact. The team believes that the filing of the CY47 was ill-\\nadvised; that a lot of the behavior cited is characteristic of \\ninstitutional living. (2) Rita wants to go home to her \\ngrandmother, cannot understand why she is moved from \\nplace to place and is apprehensive that her therapists will \\nbe taken away from her. (3) Because of the above, the team \\nwould recommend that Rita be returned to Gladys’s home \\nand continue in therapy at St. Christopher’s. \\nKiladis remembered that St. Christopher’s was unwilling \\nofficially to exonerate Juan of sexual abuse; nor would the evaluators \\naddress the possibility that Rita was being beaten by the Biancos. Rita \\nhad written a letter to her therapist at St. Christopher’s, saying that she \\nwas being beaten and generally mistreated by the Biancos and that she \\nwanted to go home to her grandmother and “pappy,” her name for Juan. \\nAlthough Kiladis had not actually handed Rita the pencil and paper to \\nwrite it, she felt somewhat implicated in the letter-writing process \\nbecause she frequently urged Rita to be frank with the people at St. \\nChristopher’s, reassuring her that what she told her therapist there \\nwould not get back to the Biancos. \\nKiladis had also told Rita to be frank with David Slade, but as it \\nhad turned out, Rita never got to talk with Slade. Although he was the \\nchild’s attorney, and according to Maynard had left “no legal stone \\nunturned,” he never went out to see the child or asked to have her \\nbrought to his office. Maynard recalled, “We did not sit down with Slade \\nand say, ‘you should see the kid.’ If we had, I think that he would have \\ngone. But we didn’t do that.” \\nAssessing Slade’s representation, Maynard observed there were \\ntwo dimensions to cases like Rita’s. First, there was the purely legal \\nobligation to pursue certain issues and employ certain procedural \\ntactics. Maynard thought that Slade clearly understood his legal \\nobligations and met them by moving for, and then supporting, \\nevaluation of Rita’s situation by an independent source. He did have a \\nconversation with the team at St. Christopher’s. He did talk with the \\nsocial worker. But he never met Rita: he never dealt with the second \\ndimension, never became involved with his client as a person, never \\ntried to make the legal objective fit the person’s needs. Kiladis said that \\nboth Rita and Gladys had called Slade’s office on numerous occasions \\nand left messages on his answering machine, but their calls were never \\nreturned. Maynard added: \\nSlade lived in another world. He lived in the \\ndowntown world of big firms; those attorneys don’t go to \\n20',\n",
       " 'Jenkintown, and they don’t go out to people’s houses, and \\nthe last thing he was going to do was to go to Gladys’s house \\nin West Philadelphia. I think that that is part of the class \\nstructure of the bar, and I think it’s a shame. Those \\nattorneys miss the chance for the type of practice that a \\ndoctor who is a general practitioner has. I have a life as full \\nof people as of law, law as a human service. It’s not for \\neverybody, but it’s for more people than you’d think if \\nthey’d give it a chance. \\nIt was not clear to Maynard what Slade was advocating. At first \\nhe had gone along with DPW, but later he opposed them as well and \\nasked for continuances. Slade seemed to feel that Rita had already lost \\nher identification as an Hispanic, and that therefore ethnicity was no \\nlonger at issue. Slade was not even present at the final two hearings in \\nthe case. \\nFurther, the PLA attorneys were able to turn Kiladis’s \\ncoincidental friendship with two of the women at DPW who were \\ninvolved with Rita’s case to Gladys’s advantage. Memos in the PLA file \\nindicate that Kiladis had long telephone conversations with Susan \\nGoldman, the supervisory social worker. Goldman had often called \\nKiladis at her home to discuss her worry over Margaret Kamin’s \\nextreme emotional involvement in Rita’s case. They also discussed the \\nCY47, which at that point was two years old and had never been \\nsubstantiated or officially pursued. Goldman felt that the psychology \\nstudent who had made the first report of sexual abuse had been under \\nconsiderable pressure, pressure to find instances of such abuse for her \\nsupervisor’s book. She and Kiladis discussed the question of why the \\nHome had chosen to move Rita into foster placement at a time when \\nmany of the professionals involved were warning against any change. \\nKiladis told Goldman of her own belief that Juan was a stabilizing \\ninfluence on the family, and that his youth counted in the family’s favor \\nif any concerns about Gladys’s failing health might arise. Kiladis \\nreassured Goldman that DPW need not rely upon Kamin’s judgment \\nthat Gladys and Juan were “okay as parents,” since St. Christopher’s \\nwas certainly very competent and would be making a favorable report. \\nSimilarly, Kiladis was continually in contact with Grace Myers, \\nthe counsel for DPW. Before Grace Myers became the attorney of record \\non the case, Kiladis had met her at the Philadelphia County Courthouse. \\nKiladis explained: \\nI had several long conversations with Grace. I knew her \\nfrom law school. When I talked with her at the courthouse, \\nI knew that some of what I was saying would get back to \\nthe department. I told her that we had a lot of cases with \\n21',\n",
       " 'the department in which we concurred with the moves that \\nthe department was making, but that we had a few where \\nwe felt that the department’s behavior was off-the-wall. \\nThe department occasionally overreacted, and Rita’s case \\nwas an example of that; they were much more upset than \\nwas warranted. \\nKiladis knew that her relationship with Myers “cut through a lot \\nof red tape.” Kiladis did not tell Myers that she thought Gladys would \\nfall apart if she had to take care of Rita without the necessary support \\nservices from DPW, but rather that there were support mechanisms in \\nplace, that Gladys was doing well with them, that Gladys was being very \\ncooperative; when the department told Gladys to do something \\ndifferently with Rita she did. Myers, according to Kiladis, “knew that I \\nbelieved in what I was saying, that Rita wanted to go to Gladys; that \\nGladys wanted her, and that there were support mechanisms at work \\nthat I had no objection to.” \\nAccording to Maynard, “it was Joan’s involvement in the case that \\nfinally won it for Gladys.” Kiladis not only spent many hours talking \\nwith Margaret Kamin, Susan Goldman and Grace Myers, she also spent \\na great deal of time with Gladys and Rita. From Jenkintown she drove \\nRita to and from St. Christopher’s and to and from Gladys’s for visits. \\nShe met Carlota and recognized the extensive contact that Rita still had \\nwith her mother. Indeed, Kiladis felt that the entire custody issue might \\nnever have arisen if Carlota had been legally represented from the start. \\nKiladis in many ways became an advisor and counselor to Gladys, \\ntalking with her about the best school placement for Manuel, and \\neventually, Rita, as well as answering Gladys’s questions about various \\npresents for Rita while the child was still living with the Biancos. \\nKiladis recalled, “I had to set limits or I would have been making up \\ngrocery lists for her.” \\nOn January 29, 1981, Kiladis filed a petition for Gladys and Juan \\nto adopt Rita. By then Kiladis herself had been with the case since the \\nfall of 1980 and had gotten to know (or knew previously) all of the \\nprofessionals involved, as well as the “principals”: Rita, Gladys, Betty \\nBianco, and even Carlota and Juan. Since Juan spoke very little English, \\nKiladis’s acquaintance with him was very limited. She had participated \\nin a conference at St. Christopher’s and knew that the hospital team’s \\nsecond report, which would come out on February 1, 1981, would contain \\na recommendation that Rita be returned to Gladys after a period of \\ngradually increasing visitation. The adoption petition, although filed, \\nwas not immediately acted upon. \\nDPW agreed to St. Christopher’s’ recommendations, and Rita \\nreturned to live with Gladys, Juan and Manuel in March 1981. She was, \\n22',\n",
       " 'however, still under the legal custody of DPW. Rita and Gladys attended \\ntherapy sessions each week at St. Christopher’s. Manuel went along at \\nfirst, but since the sessions interfered with his first love, baseball, he \\nsoon asked to be allowed not to attend. This was agreed to by the \\ntherapist at St. Christopher’s. Juan refused to go from the very \\nbeginning. Kiladis believed that his resistance arose from a combination \\nof his remaining distress about having been accused of sexually abusing \\nRita and the traditional “macho” notion that men did not talk about \\ntheir feelings. For whatever reasons, Juan said that if he had to attend \\ntherapy sessions, he was moving out. And shortly thereafter he did so, \\nmoving in with a woman his own age. \\nGladys, Manuel and Rita were now living together at Gladys’s \\nhome in West Philadelphia. Gladys was in therapy with Elizabeth \\nReilly, and Rita and Gladys continued to go to therapists at St. \\nChristopher’s. Margaret Kamin of DPW remained involved. Finally, in \\nFebruary of 1982, Kiladis convinced Susan Goldman that it was time for \\nDPW to release Rita from its custody by moving to dismiss the original \\nDPW motions for custody and to dispense with Carlota’s consent to \\nRita’s adoption. A hearing was set before Judge Yates on February 2. \\nBecause Rita was ill that day, she and Gladys did not attend. Kiladis \\nwas there, along with Grace Myers and Margaret Kamin for DPW; \\nDavid Slade was not present. Since there was no opposition to the \\ndismissal of the two motions filed by DPW, the judge was willing to \\ndismiss them. But, he asked, who would then be Rita’s guardian? Myers \\nmentioned that Gladys was legally Rita’s guardian because of the New \\nYork court order. Kiladis, not convinced of the validity of that order in \\nPennsylvania, told the judge that she had filed an adoption petition for \\nGladys and Juan. Kamin voiced some concern about allowing Rita to be \\nadopted by Gladys and Juan. All three women were concerned about the \\npossibility that if adopted, Rita might become the object of a custody \\ndispute between Gladys and Juan in the event that their separation \\nended in divorce. Judge Yates ordered a continuance. \\nIn April, when Rita’s case appeared before Judge Yates again, the \\ncast of characters had changed slightly. Rita and Gladys were present \\nwith Kiladis, and DPW was represented by Grace Myers and Susan \\nGoldman. David Slade again did not appear. Judge Yates allowed DPW \\nto dismiss its two motions, entered into the record an agreement \\nbetween Gladys and DPW for after-care services, and allowed the \\npetition for Gladys and Juan to adopt Rita, even though Juan was not \\npresent and the judge knew that Juan and Gladys were living \\nseparately. Rita ran up to the bench and hugged the judge. \\nLoose Ends \\n23',\n",
       " 'When they had finished reviewing the case, Maynard stepped out \\nof his office to get some coffee and mused about Kiladis’s involvement \\nwith the case. \\nShe came as a new student and gradually became more \\nexperienced. As she began to grow and I had more confidence in her, I \\ngave her more and more of the case. She developed an excellent \\nrelationship with Gladys. I was anxious for that to happen because I \\nneeded to separate myself from it psychologically. But, what I also saw \\ndevelop was the classic problem of over-commitment. It seemed to me \\nthat Joan took every little piece of anything that was there and blew it \\nup. At the same time she was driving Rita around town and making \\nGladys’s domestic arrangements. She made the case because of the \\namount of energy and effort that she put into it. But I never really \\nbelieved that there was a staff person at the Children’s Home who had \\nsexually abused Rita. I don’t really know, but I didn’t believe it. \\nKiladis meanwhile had rediscovered in the files a number of \\nmemos that she had written to Maynard describing conversations that \\nshe had had with Rita and with Susan Goldman from DPW. In one \\nmemo, dated December 13, 1980, Kiladis had recounted Rita’s response \\nto her direct question as to whether or not any of the males she knew \\never “got fresh with her.” \\nShe didn’t know what I meant, except for hitting, and when \\nI explained she said, “like Steve at the Home?” (only it took \\nher a little while to remember his name). Gladys explained \\nthat Steve was a social worker who came to the Home about \\nonce a month. She often saw him fondling several of the \\ngirls, including Rita. He was around in 1978 and is, from \\nwhat Rita indicated, almost certainly the cause of the \\nCY47. \\nThis conversation had taken place in Kiladis’s automobile, as did \\nthe next one, described in a memo from Kiladis to Maynard dated \\nDecember 27, 1980. \\nRita then asked me if I would forgive her for not having \\ntold me the truth. “That man at the home who kept \\nbothering me was not named Steve, his real name was Joe \\nor Joey.” He had told her that she would get into a lot of \\ntrouble if ever she told. She said that she felt badly about \\ntelling me his wrong name, and that she had known his \\nname all along. \\nKiladis remembered checking with Susan Goldman from DPW to \\nsee if the social worker knew of any “Joe” or “Joey” at the Home. In a \\n24',\n",
       " 'memo dated January 18, 1981, she put into the file a synopsis of a \\nlengthy telephone conversation that she had had with Goldman: \\nJoe/Joey is the groundskeeper at the Home and is still \\nthere. He had little contact with the kids, Susan thinks, but \\nsays that since Rita was often sick with ear infections and \\nofficially confined to bed in her cottage, what the child says \\nis possible. Susan promises to check into it, if just because \\nshe is under pressure to get greater accountability from \\npeople and places that DPW uses for placement. \\nWhile Kiladis and Maynard were both convinced that Juan had \\nnever abused Rita sexually or in any other way, Maynard had reminded \\nKiladis of the many other opportunities in Rita’s environment for sexual \\nexposure or stimulation: with other children at each of the two foster \\nhomes; with other children at the Catholic Home; with children in the \\nneighborhood around Gladys’s home; when Rita stayed at Carlota’s \\nhouse or even at the home of her Aunt Maria. \\nYet Kiladis had always been puzzled by the timing of the Home’s \\nplacement of Rita with the Biancos. Even the Home’s psychologist, who \\nfiled the CY47, had put into his report at that time that he did not “think \\nthis is an appropriate time to attempt to place this child in a foster home. \\nHer power and control struggles, her volatile emotional state mean that \\nshe will be a considerable handful for any foster parents.” Perhaps, as \\nKiladis believed, someone at the Home knew that the “father figure” \\nreferred to in the report, who was exposing the child to “sexual \\noverstimulation,” was actually a member of their own staff. Rita then \\nhad been whisked out to Jenkintown for protection, not from Juan but \\nfrom Joe. \\nAlthough convinced by this evidence that there had been sexual \\nabuse at the Home, Kiladis was not committed to the idea of suing the \\nHome on behalf of Gladys and Rita. She knew that type of trial was a \\nvery difficult one. Rita, who was not an easy child to deal with, would be \\nplaced in a very vulnerable position. Old wounds would be reopened. \\nGladys’s anger and feelings of betrayal by the Home, an institution \\nwhich was supposed to have helped Rita, would be rekindled. \\nAs Maynard returned to his office, Kiladis thought about how \\nmany other loose ends remained in this case, as in most others like it. \\nPLA knew many things about the family that DPW did not know. She \\nthought of Carlota’s continuing involvement with Gladys and Rita and \\nthe potential dangers in Rita’s exposure to a drug -dominated \\nenvironment. Moreover, there was the fact that Gladys received a full \\nmonthly allowance from the federal AFDC (Aid to Families with \\nDependent Children) program, even though (unbeknownst to the \\n25',\n",
       " 'government) Gladys and Juan who owned the building that Gladys and \\nthe children were living in, had not reported the rent they were receiving \\nfrom the two apartments in the building, the fact that they owned a \\nbuilding in Puerto Rico (which not being occupied by either of them \\nwould have disqualified Gladys from welfare), nor that Gladys was \\nworking one job under a false Social Security number given to her \\nemployer by Margaret Kamin. Where did Maynard’s and Kiladis’s duty \\nto their client begin and end? What did it require them to overlook, and \\nwhat did it require them to pursue? Should they leave Rita’s case, and \\nclose the file? \\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS \\n1. Rita’s case reflects many of the central themes of this book. \\nPerhaps the most crucial is the definition of the lawyer’s role—or, more \\naccurately, the need for self-definition, which lawyers confront \\nthroughout their legal careers. Of the three lawyers who figure in the \\ncase, one remains in the background. David Slade, Rita’s court -\\nappointed attorney, plays at best a walk-on part, largely, it seems, by \\nhis own choice. As seen through Maynard’s eyes, Slade has chosen to \\noffer technical expertise but little sensitivity to the personal and \\nrelational aspects of his cases. This downtown lawyer leaves “no legal \\nstone unturned” but finds it unnecessary actually to meet with Rita. \\nMaynard’s judgment of Slade’s performance is unsympathetic. How \\nmight Slade himself assess his representation? What might account for \\nhis conduct? \\n2. The other two lawyers in the case, Maynard and Kiladis, \\ndefine their roles quite differently. Maynard sees his function primarily \\nas representing Gladys, the Legal Aid Society’s client: \\nI did not decide that I was the lawyer to the whole situation \\nto decide what was best for Rita. Within certain limits, I \\nreally did and do allow my role as an advocate in the \\nsituation to take its course. \\nKiladis, by contrast, admits: \\nIt wasn’t clear whose attorney I was; what I was advocating \\nfor, and so on. Knowing Rita’s needs as well as Gladys’s and \\neventually even Carlota’s created a lot of tension for me. \\nTheir needs were different and it was not clear how to \\nbargain them out; whether to try to get the maximum good \\nfor everyone or just for our client, Gladys. \\n3. In the end, is it clear how Kiladis resolves this tension? Is \\nit appropriate for her even to consider trying “to get the maximum good \\nfor everyone” rather than only for Gladys? Does this approach breach \\nany obligations to the client? On the other hand, Maynard is convinced \\n26',\n",
       " 'that “it was Joan’s involvement in the case that finally won it for \\nGladys”—an involvement that included spending many hours with Rita. \\nWould attorneys who define their roles purely as “advocates” for their \\nclient be likely to invest this amount of time to help another party? \\n4. Suppose that you were one of the Legal Aid attorneys in \\nthis case. If you believed that the best outcome for Gladys would be \\ninconsistent with the best outcome for Rita, would that affect your choice \\nof roles? Would your answer turn on the inadequacy of Rita’s \\nrepresentation by David Slade? If so, what about other individuals \\nwhose interests were unrepresented—Juan, Carlota, the children in the \\nCatholic home? How should such concerns affect attorneys’ ethical \\nobligations? \\n5. What factors should guide lawyers in choosing between the \\nrole of advocate and what Maynard calls “lawyer to the whole situation”? \\nConsider the following issues. \\nThe Law of Lawyering \\nTo what extent do the rules dictate a particular role? Should a \\nlawyer be subject to discipline for choosing the “wrong” role? Did either \\nMaynard’s or Kiladis’s approach violate any of the bar’s codified \\nrequirements? See Rules 1.2, 1.3, and 2.1. \\nThe Traditions and Practices of the Bar \\nTo what extent do the conventional practices and traditions of the \\nbar help lawyers define their obligations in circumstances like Rita’s \\ncase? What if there are competing norms and traditions? Obviously, the \\nzealous advocate is a well-established role, but so is the nonpartisan \\ncounselor who attempts to reconcile competing interests. Maynard’s \\nterm “lawyer to the whole situation” paraphrases Supreme Court \\nJustice Louis Brandeis’s description of his own practice of mediating \\nbetween clients and other parties.1  As Chapter 4 makes clear, \\nBrandeis’s approach has been highly influential. \\nThe role of “lawyer for the situation” implies greater \\nindependence from the client than the advocate’s role. Thus Brandeis  \\nonce wrote in a memorandum to himself: “Advise client what he should \\nhave—not what he wants.” 2  How desirable is this role definition? Is it \\nthe one Kiladis adopted? Should it matter whether the client can afford \\nto hire another attorney who might see the issues differently? \\n \\n1 See John P. Frank, The Legal Ethics of Louis D. Brandeis, 17 STAN. L. REV. \\n683 (1965). \\n2 PHILIPPA STRUM, LOUIS D. BRANDEIS: JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE 40 (1984) \\n(quoting Brandeis). \\n27',\n",
       " 'Ethical Principles \\nTo what extent should lawyers’ choice of roles depend on their \\nethical principles? What arguments might be made on behalf of \\nMaynard’s and Kiladis’s different visions of professional responsibility? \\nPersonal Style \\nHow much discretion should lawyers have to select or adapt a role \\nto fit their personalities and priorities? Should so important an issue be \\nleft to the preferences of individual attorneys? Is there any practical \\nalternative? \\nConfidentiality, Advocacy, and Contextual Decision Making \\nHow easily can or should lawyers shift from one role to another \\ndepending upon the particular context? Maynard acknowledges that if \\nhe had believed that Rita was being abused in Gladys’s home, he might \\nnot have adopted the advocate’s stance. So too, Kiladis’s choice of role \\napparently depended in large measure on the inadequacy of \\nrepresentation of a vulnerable child. In a different context, she might \\nnot have experienced the same tensions in the advocate’s role. \\nIf such contextual factors affect a lawyer’s definition of role, do \\nthey also impose any obligations to third parties? If Maynard had known \\nof child abuse, should he have disclosed it? Should Kiladis have informed \\nthe Biancos and Carlota that they were entitled to court-appointed \\nattorneys? \\n6. At the end of the case, Maynard and Kiladis are \\ndeliberating about whether to sue the Catholic Home for Children. \\nKiladis has become convinced that a child abuser works as one of the \\nHome’s groundskeepers, but fears that such a suit might have \\ndevastating effects on Rita and Gladys. Yet failing to bring formal \\ncharges could endanger other children. How should the lawyers resolve \\nthis dilemma? Should the considerations be different for “an advocate” \\nthan for a “lawyer for the situation”? Are there any alternatives besides \\nlitigation that might avoid the dilemma? \\n7. Are any of Maynard’s and Kiladis’s legal tactics \\nproblematic? For example, is it appropriate for them to “neutralize” \\nother professionals in the case: the psychiatrists at St. Christopher’s, \\nMary Nota, Margaret Kamin, Susan Goldman, and Grace Myers? \\nKiladis withholds from Grace Myers, a law school acquaintance, the \\nbelief that Gladys is unable to care for Rita without outside support \\nservices, as well as the knowledge that the legal basis for Gladys’s \\nguardianship is dubious. Kiladis and Maynard also keep this \\ninformation from the court. Is that proper? Does it matter whether \\nnondisclosure involves a matter of fact or a matter of law? What about \\n28',\n",

See Rules 1.2(d), 1.6, 3.3, and 4.1. \\n8. Maynard and Kiladis have several private conversations \\nwith DPW personnel, including Mary Nota and Margaret Kamin. From \\none perspective, these conversations appear perfectly appropriate: \\nGladys’s lawyers should be able to discuss her case with the relevant \\nofficials. However, Maynard and Kiladis structure these encounters for \\nadversarial purposes; the objective is to “neutralize” the officials. DPW \\nhas its own legal counsel, and Rule 4.2 forbids lawyers to engage in ex \\nparte contacts with other represented parties unless authorized by law. \\nDid Maynard and Kiladis violate this Rule? Or were the conversations \\nthe kind of communications with government officials that are \\n“authorized” by law? Did Kiladis’s extensive personal involvement with \\nRita without David Slade’s consent violate Rule 4.2? Did it violate \\nconflict of interest rules that require a lawyer to maintain independent \\nprofessional judgment? \\n9. Another important issue in Rita’s case involves the \\nallocation of power between lawyers and clients. In theory, attorneys are \\nagents of those they represent. In practice, the Legal Aid lawyers in this \\ncase “whether knowingly or unknowingly, [often] steered clients’ \\nchoices.” For example, at one point Maynard talks Gladys out of seeking \\nimmediate visitation rights, because “his legal instincts told him he \\ncould best manage the case by drawing things out for quite awhile \\ndespite Gladys’s desire to act immediately.” When Maynard advises \\nGladys that they should not immediately seek visitation because they \\ncould not win, is he giving her any real choice? Such opposition to the \\nclient’s wishes for the client’s own good is an example of paternalism, \\ndiscussed more fully in Chapter 5. Under what circumstances is it \\njustified? Is paternalism ever consistent with the advocate’s role? See \\nRules 1.2(a) and 1.14. \\n10. In the end, Gladys adopts Rita. Is this an outcome that \\nGladys genuinely desires, or is it an instance of lawyers’ shaping client \\nchoices to fit the legal alternatives readily available? From the outset of \\nthe case, Gladys expresses ambivalence. She wants to keep Rita, but she \\nalso wants public agencies to provide care in those intervals when she is \\nunable to cope. Should Kiladis and Maynard have tried to formalize such \\nan arrangement rather than pursuing adoption? What would the likely \\nresponse have been by the court, by welfare officials, or by Rita’s \\nattorney? Does the adoption raise other ethical concerns? Should Juan \\nhave been a party, given that he is likely to separate from Gladys? What \\nabout Carlota’s rights? How should their interests have been handled? \\n29',\n",
       " '11. Does the fact that this is a legal aid case present special \\nproblems of legal ethics and legal process?

Boies \\nresponded, “Well, it could you know. If I’m Harvey’s lawyer, I’m going to \\ntry to keep things under wraps.

Boies stated:  \\nA lawyer can choose what clients to represent. A lawyer \\ndoes not have the choice of how to represent a client. A \\nlawyer is duty-and-honor-bound to represent a client \\neffectively and aggressively, within the bounds of the \\nsystem itself. A lawyer does not have the right to abandon \\nthat client under fire, except in extraordinary \\ncircumstances.15   \\nEvaluations of Boies’s conduct varied. “I don’t think this will hurt \\nfrom a business perspective,” said ethics professor Rebecca Roiphe. “It \\nis not going to harm his reputation with most clients. When you hire \\nBoies, you are hiring an aggressive lawyer.”16 Deborah Rhode, in a New \\nYork Times op-ed, was more critical:   \\nThe time to dissuade Mr. Weinstein from persisting in \\nsexually abusive conduct and hiring investigators to hush \\nit up was when that conduct was occurring. For Mr. Boies \\nto condemn Mr. Weinstein’s conduct now seems like \\nthrowing a former client under the bus in the hopes of \\nsalvaging his own reputation.

Is Boies’s \\ndescription of withdrawal consistent with Rule 1.16? \\nThe Conflicts Questions \\nAs noted earlier, Boies signed a contract on Weinstein’s behalf \\nwith the Black Cube private investigation organization that directed it \\nto uncover “intelligence which will help the client’s efforts to completely \\nstop the publication of a new negative article in a leading NY \\nNewspaper.”18 The newspaper was the New York Times, a prominent \\nclient of Boies Schiller Flexner. When the Boies Schiller-Black Cube \\ncontract surfaced, the Times’s lawyers denounced Boies’s conduct as a \\n“grave betrayal of trust” and terminated the firm: \\n“We learned today that the law firm of Boies Schiller and \\nFlexner secretly worked to stop our reporting on Harvey \\nWeinstein at the same time as the firm’s lawyers were \\nrepresenting us in other matters … We consider this \\nintolerable conduct, a grave betrayal of trust, and a breach \\nof the basic professional standards that all lawyers are \\nrequired to observe. It is inexcusable and we will be \\npursuing appropriate remedies.”19 \\nBoies, however, denied that efforts to discredit the Times story \\nreflected such a conflict. In his view, it was “entirely appropri ate to \\ninvestigate precisely what [Weinstein] was accused of doing and to \\ninvestigate whether there were facts that would rebut those \\naccusations.” He added: “If evidence could be uncovered to convince the \\nTimes the charges should not be published, I did not believe, and do not \\nbelieve, that that would be adverse to the Times’s interests.”20  \\nOne commentator expressed skepticism: But what we know from \\nWeinstein’s past behavior … (and it does not take much imagination to \\nguess that it was familiar to Boies as Weinstein’s longtime legal advisor) \\nis not only to attack the facts … but to attack the accuser’s overall \\n \\n18 Farrow, supra note 3.  \\n19 Jim Rutenberg, Report Details Weinstein’s Covert Attempt to Halt Publication of \\nAccusations, NY TIMES, Nov. 7, 2017. \\n20 Boies, quoted in Rozen, supra note 12.  \\n35',\n",
       " 'credibility on the sadly familiar character grounds that she is \\npromiscuous, voraciously ambitious, greedy, dishonest, etc.”21  \\n \\nQUESTION 4: Is Weinstein’s supposed strategy of \\nbullying and threatening victims into remaining silent \\nrelevant to the issue of whether Boies had a conflict of \\ninterest because of his joint representation of Weinstein \\nand the Times? Does Boies’s description of his aim in \\nretaining Black Cube—to help the Times avoid \\nembarrassing itself by publishing false allegations—\\nsquare with the objective in the Black Cube contract: \\n“Provide intelligence which will help the Client’s efforts to \\ncompletely stop the publication of a new negative article in \\na leading NY newspaper”? \\nBoies also pointed out that his firm had a clause in its retainer \\nagreement with the Times that purported to waive all conflicts of \\ninterest on matters unrelated to the matter on which the newspaper had \\nretained the firm, including a libel lawsuit. 22 Specifically, the retainer \\nagreement stated that the firm might engage with clients outside the \\nlibel lawsuit “where the interests of the other persons, and the Firm’s \\nrepresentation of them, may be against the [Times’s interests], including \\nadversity in litigation.”23  \\nThe Times responded to that claim by stating that it never \\ncontemplated that Boies Schiller would contract with investigators to do \\nopposition research on its own reporters. Specifically, the Times \\ninsisted: \\nWe never contemplated that the law firm would contract \\nwith an intelligence firm to conduct a secret spying \\noperation aimed at our reporting and our reporters. Such \\nan operation is reprehensible, and the Boies firm must \\nhave known that its existence would have been material to \\nour decision whether to continue using the firm.

       " 'Case Study 3: \\nACLU Counsel Representing an Undocumented Minor \\nSeeking an Abortion \\n \\nThis case study is a document-based exercise: after summarizing \\nthe case, with its rather complicated and contested facts, it asks you to \\nread excerpts from dueling briefs to the Supreme Court about whether \\nattorneys representing a pregnant minor in immigration custody should \\nbe disciplined for misleading government lawyers in hotly-contested \\nlitigation regarding her desire to have an abortion. \\nThe main ethics questions: did the lawyers’ failure to tell the \\ngovernment that their client would have the abortion she desired sooner \\nthan government lawyers believed she would constitute fraud? Or was \\nit required by their duties of confidentiality and zealous advocacy? \\nAnswering these questions involves close parsing of both the \\nModel Rules on confidentiality, truthfulness, and honesty, and \\nRestatement standards on what counts as fraud by omission. But it also \\nrequires you to think about the nature of adversary litigation. \\nThe case is doubly interesting because the Supreme Court had an \\nopportunity to answer these questions, but instead ducked the issue—\\nwhich therefore remains a live one. \\nAnother ethics question concerns the tactics of government \\nlawyers, who may have been drawing out the litigation to delay the \\nabortion until it was too late.  \\n__________ \\nThe case concerns litigation in 2017 involving Jane Doe, a 17-year \\nold held in Texas in immigration detention, who learned while in \\ndetention that she was pregnant, and sought an abortion. Texas law \\nrequires that anyone seeking an abortion must undergo counseling at \\nleast 24 hours in advance, by the same physician who will perform the \\nabortion. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR)—in charge of her \\ndetention—denied her permission to leave the detention facility for the \\nabortion procedure itself, because in ORR’s view that would be \\nfacilitating the abortion. According to ORR policy, a n undocumented \\nminor has only two pathways to release from immigration detention: she \\ncan accept voluntary departure back to her country of origin, or she can \\nfind an adult sponsor in the United States to whom she can be released. \\nSuch a sponsor must be vetted by HHS, a potentially time -consuming \\nprocess. Jane Doe’s pregnancy was far enough advanced that the vetting \\nmight have taken too long for her to have the abortion she desired, \\n41',\n",
       " 'because Texas law prohibits abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy. \\nJane Doe was in her 16th week. \\nContentious emergency litigation followed. Jane Doe’s guardian \\nad litem, working in tandem with the ACLU, challenged the ORR policy \\nin federal district court as a violation of Jane Doe’s constitutional right \\nto an abortion, and requested a court order to force the government to \\nrelease her to the Texas clinic where the abortion would take place. That \\nwas on October 13, 2017. The District Court agreed with her on October \\n18, and issued the order. The government appealed to the D.C. Circuit \\nCourt of Appeals, and two days later (October 20), a divided panel of the \\nD.C. Circuit reversed. Jane Doe requested an emergency en banc \\nrehearing, and the D.C. Circuit sitting en banc  reversed the panel \\ndecision and ordered the government not to prevent her release; two \\nhours later, the District Court amended the order to require the \\ngovernment to release Jane Doe immediately. That was at 4 p.m. on \\nOctober 24. \\n The subsequent events are described in the briefs below; because \\nthe two sides “spin” these facts rather differently, we will not fully \\ndescribe them here. In (very) brief: Jane Doe had received the legally-\\nrequired abortion counseling prior to the last-minute litigation; but at \\nthe time of her courtroom victory on October 24, the physician who \\ncounseled her was not available to perform the procedure. It appeared, \\nthen, that a different physician would counsel her on October 25, and \\nshe would have the abortion on October 26. \\nBut the night of October 24, the original physician became \\navailable. Jane Doe’s representatives pushed her October 25 medical \\nappointment back from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 a.m., and informed the \\ngovernment of the change in schedule. They did not inform the \\ngovernment that the appointment’s purpose had changed from \\ncounseling to the abortion itself.  \\nThe upshot was that: \\n1. Jane Doe was released from detention at 4:15 a.m. on October \\n25 and had the abortion a few hours later. In the 12 hours between the \\ncourt order and the abortion, the government did not file an emergency \\nappeal for a stay with the Supreme Court to prevent the abortion. \\n2. The government accused Jane Doe’s counsel of deceiving them \\nabout the timing of the abortion. Specifically, Jane Doe’s counsel did not \\ninform them that her appointment for counseling was changed at the \\nlast minute to an appointment for the abortion itself. That led the \\ngovernment to believe it had extra time to appeal to the Supreme Court.  \\n3. Nine days later, the Solicitor General filed a certiorari petition, \\nasking the Supreme Court to vacate the en banc D.C. Court of Appeals \\n42',\n",
       " 'decision that ORR’s policy violates the constitutional right to abortion. \\nOne of the grounds for seeking cert was the alleged deception by Jane \\nDoe’s counsel. \\n4. Furthermore, the SG’s cert petition asked the Supreme Court \\nto demand that Jane Doe’s counsel show cause why they should not be \\ndisciplined, either by the Court itself or by being referred to their states’ \\nbar counsel.  \\n5. ACLU counsel replied that they had not committed any ethics \\nviolation, and indeed that informing the government of the changed \\npurpose of her clinic visit would violate their ethical obligations to their \\nclient. \\n6. In a per curiam decision, the Supreme Court granted cert to \\nconsider the underlying legal issue: the constitutionality of ORR’s policy \\nregarding pregnant minors who seek abortions. The Court agreed with \\nthe government that the D.C. Circuit’s opinions should be vacated, but \\nfor reasons not relevant to the ethics issue. 1 On the ethics issue, \\nhowever, the Court punted: \\nThe Court takes allegations like those the Government \\nmakes here seriously, for ethical rules are necessary to the \\nmaintenance of a culture of civility and mutual trust within \\nthe legal profession. On the one hand, all attorneys must \\nremain aware of the principle that zealous advocacy does \\nnot displace their obligations as officers of the court. \\nEspecially in fast-paced, emergency proceedings like those \\nat issue here, it is critical that lawyers and courts alike be \\nable to rely on one another’s representations. On the other \\nhand, lawyers also have ethical obligations to their clients \\nand not all communication breakdowns constitute \\nmisconduct. The Court need not delve into the factual \\ndisputes raised by the parties in order to answer the \\nMunsingwear question here.2 \\nThis on-the-one-hand-on-the-other-hand paragraph, coupled with the \\nmany months it took for the Court to decide on the cert petition, strongly \\nsuggests that the Justices could not agree about the ethics issue, nor \\nwhether the Court should take steps against Jane Doe’s lawyers. \\n__________ \\n \\n1 Azar v.

       " 'This case study is about the ethics issue. Your assignment is to \\nread the briefs excerpted below and analyze the ethics issues. \\nTwo additional pieces of information, not included in the briefs, \\nmay be relevant to your analysis: \\nFirst, as mentioned above, Jane Doe was 16 weeks pregnant at \\nthe time of these events. Under Texas law, abortion after week 20 is \\nillegal. There was reason to believe that prolonged legal proceedings, \\ncoupled with the government’s proposed vetting of potential sponsors for \\nJane Doe on an uncertain timetable, would delay the proposed abortion \\nbeyond the legal cut-off date. \\nSecond, Scott Lloyd, the head of ORR, made his strong opposition \\nto abortion clear in a public statement regarding another case, involving \\n“Jane Poe.” Jane Poe was a minor in ORR detention who was pregnant \\ndue to rape. In declining to permit her temporary release to obtain an \\nabortion, Mr. Lloyd explained that his decision was guided by the belief \\nthat abortion is never in the best interests of a minor. That is because of \\nthe potential trauma and regret over aborting one’s child. He added: \\nI am mindful that abortion is offered by some as a solution \\nto a rape. …  \\nI disagree. Implicit here are the dubious notions that it is \\npossible to cure violence with further violence, and that the \\ndestruction of an unborn child’s life can in some instances \\nbe acceptable as a means to an end. To decline to assist in \\nan abortion here is to decline to participate in violence \\nagainst an innocent life.  \\nMr. Lloyd concluded: \\nThe Office of Refugee Resettlement serves a large number \\nof persons who have experienced some sort of violence. \\nRefuge is the basis of our name and is at the core of what \\nwe provide, and we provide this to all the minors in our \\ncare, including their unborn children…. 3 \\nMr. Lloyd’s statement came during the pendency of the cert petition, \\nand made matters somewhat awkward for government lawyers.

She learns that she is pregnant. \\nShe requests an abortion. (Undocumented aliens have the same \\nconstitutional right to abortion as citizens.) However, ORR refuses to \\nrelease her from detention to go to the abortion clinic. \\nRepresented by a local guardian ad litem and by the ACLU, she sues. \\nUnder Texas law, women must receive abortion counseling at least 24 \\nhours in advance of the abortion, from the same physician who will \\nperform the abortion. \\nWednesday, October 18 \\nJane Doe wins in federal District Court, which grants a temporary \\nrestraining order (TRO) against ORR’s policy and orders Doe’s release \\nto the clinic for the legally-mandated abortion counseling, to be followed \\nby the abortion. \\nThe government requests an emergency stay of the TRO from the D.C. \\nCircuit Court of Appeals. \\nThursday, October 19 \\nJane Doe receives abortion counseling from Dr. A [unnamed in the \\ndocuments, identified here as “Dr. A” for ease of reference]. \\n4 However, Judge Henderson, dissenting from the D.C. Circuit’s en banc opinion, \\nexpressed doubt that illegal immigrants enjoy full constitutional rights. Judge (now \\nJustice) Kavanaugh also dissented, as did Judge Griffith. \\n45',\n",

Jane Doe’s counsel petition the District Court to modify \\nthe TRO and order Doe’s immediate release and transportation to the \\nclinic.  \\n \\nDoe’s counsel explains that Dr. A is currently unavailable, \\nso she will receive the legally-mandated counseling that \\nday from Dr. B, who will perform the abortion on the \\nfollowing day, Wednesday. \\n \\n4:15 p.m.  The District Court modifies the TRO to order Jane Doe’s \\nrelease. \\n \\n5:26 p.m. In an email exchange to arrange Doe’s transport from the \\nshelter to the clinic, DOJ counsel asks for clarification of the time of the \\nabortion, and ACLU counsel responds, “As soon as we understand the \\nclinic’s schedule tomorrow we will let you know.” \\n \\n6 p.m. Jane Doe misses the window for her counseling appointment and \\nreturns to detention. \\n \\n6:17 p.m.  Doe’s counsel informs the government of the missed \\nappointment, and states that the appointment is now scheduled for 7:30 \\na.m. the following day, Wednesday. \\n \\n8:13 p.m.  DOJ counsel informs Doe’s counsel that they will seek an \\nemergency stay from the Supreme Court on Wednesday. \\n \\n9:31 p.m. Doe’s counsel informs the shelter that her clinic appointment \\nhas been moved back to 4:15 a.m. on Wednesday, and asks that she be \\n46',\n",

When Ms. Doe could not \\nreceive counseling from a physician on the evening of October 24, her \\nrepresentatives informed the government that her appointment would be \\nmoved to the morning of October 25, pushing the abortion procedure to October \\n26. The government asked to be kept informed of the timing of Ms. Doe’s \\nabortion procedure, and one of respondent’s counsel agreed to do so. \\n  \\nBased on those representations, the government informed this Court’s \\nClerk’s Office and respondent’s counsel that it would file a stay application the \\nfollowing morning, October 25. At that point, by their own account, Ms. Doe’s \\nrepresentatives did three things: they secured the services of Ms. Doe’s original \\nphysician (who had provided counseling the previous week), moved her \\nappointment from 7:30 to 4:15 a.m. on the morning of October 25, and changed \\nthe appointment from counseling to an abortion. Although Ms. Doe’s \\nrepresentatives informed the government of the change in timing, they did not \\ninform the government of the other two developments— which kept the \\ngovernment in the dark about wh en Ms. Doe was scheduled to have an \\nabortion. The government did not learn that critical fact until shelter personnel \\narrived with Ms. Doe at the clinic for her early -morning appointment on \\nOctober 25. The government’s efforts to reach respondent’s counsel were met \\nwith silence, until approximately 10 a.m. Eastern Time, when one of \\nrespondent’s counsel notified the government that Ms. Doe had undergone an \\nabortion. . . .   \\n   \\nCounsel’s representations to the district court on October 24 confirmed \\nthat Ms. Doe would need to participate in a new counseling session and then \\nwait a day before she could undergo an abortion. Counsel asked the court to \\norder the government to make Ms. Doe available “promptly and without delay, \\non such dates, including today, *** in order to obtain the counseling required \\n48',\n",
       " 'by state law and to obtain the abortion procedure. ” Counsel stated: “Plaintiff \\nhas been informed, and represents to the Court, that a qualified physician is \\navailable at the nearest clinic today, and will be availab le to perform the \\nprocedure tomorrow.’ ” (emphasis added). Counsel thus reaffirmed to the court \\nthat for Ms. Doe to obtain an abortion, she would need to complete a two-step, \\n24-hour process.\\nb. Following the district court’s entry of the modified TRO at\\napproximately 5 p.m. on October 24, counsel made similar representations \\ndirectly to the government. First, Ms. Doe’s guardian ad litem, attorney ad \\nlitem, and counsel from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) all \\nrequested that the Texas shelter transport Ms. Doe to the clinic immediately. \\nAt 6:13 p.m. on October 24, government counsel contacted respondent’s counsel \\nby telephone, confirming that she was being transported to the clinic and \\nasking to be apprised of the timing of any appointments. Government counsel \\nfollowed up with an email to respondent’s counsel, confirming that the shelter \\nwas transporting Ms. Doe to the clinic on October 24, and asking to be notified \\nof the timing of “tomorrow’s procedure.” At 6:28 p.m., respondent’s counsel \\nconfirmed receipt of the email and phone call, and assured government counsel \\nthat “[a]s soon as we understand the clinic’s schedule tomorrow we will let you \\nknow.”  \\nRoughly 45 minutes later, respondent’s counsel informed government \\ncounsel that the doctor was not able to stay for the appointment that evening, \\nwhich would be rescheduled for the following morning at 7:30 a.m. Around the \\nsame time, Ms. Doe’s attorney ad litem separately informed the assigned \\nAssistant United States Attorney (AUSA) that Ms. Doe’s previous doctor was \\nnot available; that it was no longer feasible for Ms. Doe to receive counseling \\nthat evening (October 24); and that as a result the abortion could not take place \\nuntil October 26. Ms. Doe’s attorney ad litem further stated that the doctor had \\nagreed to stay for an extra day, in order to perform the abortion on October 26. \\nc. These representations made clear that the appointment rescheduled\\nfor the morning of October 25 would be for counseling, with an abortion to \\nfo\\nllow no earlier than the morning of October 26. By their own \\nacknowledgement, respondent’s counsel shared that understanding. See Letter \\nfrom David D. Cole, Nat’l Legal Dir., Am. Civil Liberties Union, to Noel J. \\nFrancisco, Solicitor Gen. 2 (Oct. 30, 2017) (ACLU Letter) (lodg ed with the \\nCourt) (“We did not become aware, until late in the evening of October 24, that \\nit might be possible for the physician who had counseled Ms. Doe on October \\n19 to return to the clinic to perform the abortion on the morning of October 25. \\nIt was not clear until the morning of October 25 that he would in fact be able \\nto do so.”). … \\nLater that night, Ms. Doe’s guardian ad litem informed the Texas \\nshelter and the AUSA that Ms. Doe’s appointment had been moved to 4:15 a.m. \\nCentral Time. The email did not explain the reason for the change nor state \\nthat the appointment was now for an abortion. In addition, neither the AUSA \\nnor the shelter was instructed to refrain from giving Ms. Doe food or drink \\n49',\n",
       " 'before the appointment, as would have been medically indicated if the \\nappointment were for an abortion. Although the change in the appointment \\ntime caused shelter staff to wonder later that night whether the nature of the \\nappointment also might have changed, they were never told that the early -\\nmorning appointment would be for an abortion rather than counseling. \\n  \\nRespondent’s counsel has now explained that, unbeknownst to the \\ngovernment, at some point “late in the evening of October 24,” they became \\n“aware” that “it might be possible for the physician who had counseled Ms. Doe \\non October 19 to return to the clinic to perform the abortion on the morning of \\nOctober 25.” Respondent’s counsel has further explained that at some point \\nearly in the morning of October 25, it became “clear” that the original doctor \\n“would in fact be able to” perform the procedure that morning. Significantly, \\nhowever, respondent’s counsel did not notify the government of this \\npossibility— notwithstanding their earlier acquiescence in a request to keep \\ngovernment counsel informed of the ti ming of the “procedure” and the \\ngovernment’s subsequent notice of its intent to seek relief in this Court that \\nsame morning. \\n  \\nAt 4:15 a.m. Central Time on the morning of October 25, shelter staff \\narrived with Ms. Doe at the clinic. At 4:30 a.m. Central Ti me, shelter staff \\nemailed government personnel that the clinic had indicated that Ms. Doe \\nwould be undergoing an abortion. After receiving that information, \\ngovernment counsel twice emailed respondent’s counsel to inquire as to the \\nnature of the appointment. Two hours after the government’s first email was \\nsent, counsel informed the government that Ms. Doe “had the abortion this \\nmorning.” Because these developments precluded any possibility of effective \\nrelief, the government did not file its stay application with the Court. . . . \\n  \\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \\nThis appeal presented the question whether the government must \\nfacilitate access to an abortion that is not medically necessary to preserve the \\nlife or health of an unaccompanied alien minor who was apprehended \\nunlawfully entering the United States, who declines to request voluntary \\ndeparture to her home country, who has not yet identified a qualified sponsor \\nto whom she can be released, and who thus is in the government’s custody. The \\nanswer to that question is no. …  \\n  \\nThe divided en banc court of appeals reached the contrary conclusion on \\nthe afternoon of October 24. Over the dissent of three judges, without holding \\noral argument, and after requiring the government to oppose the petition for \\nrehearing en banc  literally overnight, the en b anc court vacated the panel \\nmajority’s decision that had put in place a modest period of time— 11 additional \\ndays— for the parties to secure a sponsor to whom Ms. Doe could be released. \\nThat narrow ruling, which had the potential to permit Ms. Doe to access an \\nabortion without requiring the government to facilitate it, was far more \\n50',\n",
       " 'appropriate in the circumstances of this case than the en banc court’s sweeping \\nconstitutional rule and the district court’s order for immediate relief that would \\nbe final rather than “temporary.” \\n  \\nThe government therefore was prepared to seek emergency relief from \\nthis Court, both because it disagreed with the merits of the en banc court’s \\nruling and because HHS believed it had identified a potential sponsor. But Ms. \\nDoe’s counsel ensured that did not happen. Although they had represented to \\nthe government that, in light of Texas law and logistical constraints, no \\nabortion would occur until the morning of October 26— and although the \\ngovernment had relied on those representations in  deciding to file its \\napplication for a stay on the morning of October 25 and informed respondent’s \\ncounsel of its intent to so file — Ms.  Doe then underwent an abortion a few \\nhours before the government would seek relief from this Court. Respondent’s \\ncounsel provided no notice to the government of that critical development, \\ndespite their previous acquiescence in government counsel’s request that the \\ngovernment be kept informed of the scheduling of the abortion “procedure.” . . \\n. \\n  \\n[Eds.: The ethics complaint:] \\n \\n4. Finally, in light of the extraordinary circumstances of this case, the \\ngovernment respectfully submits that this Court may wish to issue an order to \\nshow cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against respondent’s \\ncounsel— either directly by this Court or through referral to the state bars to \\nwhich counsel belong— for what appear to be material misrepresentations and \\nomissions to government counsel designed to thwart this Court’s review. . . . \\n  \\nRespondent’s counsel have taken the p osition that they did not have \\n“any legal or ethical obligation” to keep the government informed of the timing \\nof Ms. Doe’s abortion. Perhaps that would be true if there had not been \\nnumerous filings and representations by counsel about the timing of that \\nprocedure. But they repeatedly represented — to courts and government \\ncounsel— that Ms. Doe would need to attend a new counseling session with a \\nnew doctor and wait 24 hours before she could obtain an abortion. Those \\nrepresentations were part of their request for immediate relief from the district \\ncourt, which the court granted shortly after the court of appeals’ ruling. Once \\nthe district court did so, government counsel asked to be notified of the timing \\nof Ms. Doe’s abortion, and respondent’s counsel responded that “[a]s soon as \\nwe understand the clinic’s schedule tomorrow we will let you know.” Ms. Doe’s \\nattorney ad litem separately informed the AUSA that the doctor had agreed to \\nstay an extra day, so that the abortion would take place on October 26. \\n  \\nIt was against that backdrop that the government decided to file its stay \\napplication on the morning of October 25, which should have allowed a full day \\nfor this Court to consider the application (and the government’s accompanying \\nrequest for an administrative stay) before Ms. Doe underwent an abortion. The \\ngovernment informed respondent’s counsel of its intent to file the next \\nmorning. As the ACLU has now explained, at some point thereafter — and \\n51',\n",
       " 'perhaps as a response to the government’s notice— Ms. Doe’s representatives \\nsecured the services of her original physician and changed the purpose of her \\nOctober 25 morning appointment. Given the dealings between the parties, \\nrespondent’s counsel at least arguably had an obligation to notify the \\ngovernment of this incredib ly significant development. Applicants for \\nemergency relief— for instance, in the capital context — often face imminent \\naction by the opposing party, and in the absence of judicial relief, the \\nchallenged action generally may proceed. But that does not mean that those \\nplanning to take authorized action may covertly change its timing, without \\nnotice to those affected by the change and in full awareness that opposing \\ncounsel has relied upon previous representations. The government recognizes \\nthat respondent’s counsel have a duty to zealously advocate on behalf of their \\nclient, but they also have duties to this Court and to the Bar. It appears under \\nthe circumstances that those duties may have been violated, and that \\ndisciplinary action may therefore be warranted. At the least, this Court may \\nwish to seek an explanation from counsel regarding this highly unusual chain \\nof events. . . . \\n \\n \\nHargan v.

After \\nreceiving a medical examination and being informed she was pregnant, Ms. \\nDoe told shelter staff that she wanted an abortion. With the help of two court-\\nappointed representatives, she received permission from a Texas state court to \\nbypass the State’s parental consent law and to consent to the abortion herself. \\nShe then sought to attend state-mandated pre-abortion counseling at a local \\n52',\n",
       " 'clinic. Pursuant to a policy adopted in March 2017 by the Director of the Office \\nof Refugee Resettlement (ORR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human \\nServices (HHS)— and in stark contrast to the policies of U.S. Immigration and \\nCustoms Enforcement (ICE) and  the Bureau of Prisons (BOP)— the \\ngovernment refused to allow Ms. Doe to attend any abortion -related \\nappointments. \\nMs. Doe brought suit in federal district court seeking to enforce her \\nright to an abortion, consistent with the Constitution and the state cou rt’s \\norder. The government did not contest Ms. Doe’s claim that she has a \\nconstitutional right to an abortion. Nor did it argue that allowing her to attend \\nthe appointments would violate statutory restrictions on the use of federal \\nfunds or any federal regulations. Instead, it argued that it should not have to \\n“facilitate” her access to an abortion— even if it did not pay for, or transport \\nMs. Doe to, any appointments. Because she was in federal custody, this policy \\nprevented Ms. Doe from exercising what the government did not contest is her \\nconstitutional right. \\nOn October 18, 2017, the district court issued a temporary restraining \\norder (TRO) that, among other things, directed the defendants to allow Ms. \\nDoe to attend the necessary appointments. The same day, the government \\nsought an emergency stay pending appeal, which a panel of the D.C. Circuit \\ngranted in part on October 20. On October 24, however, the D.C. Circuit en \\nbanc granted rehearing and denied the government’s emergency request for a \\nstay. This time, the government did not seek an immediate stay, even though \\nnothing precluded it from doing so. On the next day, October 25, one month \\nafter the state court authorized Ms. Doe to obtain an abortion, she finally had \\nthe procedure. \\nHaving failed to seek an emergency stay from this Court on October 24, \\nas it had from the D.C. Circuit on the day the district court granted the TRO, \\nthe government filed this petition nine days after the events that it claims have \\nrendered the issues in this case moot. The government does not seek review of \\nthe single legal issue decided by the court of appeals — whether the \\ngovernment’s application for a stay pending appeal met the standards for \\nobtaining such relief. Rather, it asks this Court to vacate that emergency, \\ninterlocutory ruling on the ground that some of Ms. Doe’s claims for relief have \\nbeen mooted by her abortion. The government then suggests that this Court \\nshould decide, in the first instance, that claims Ms. Doe seeks to bring on behalf \\nof herself and a class are likewise moot and dismiss those claims now while \\nthey remain pending in district court. Simultaneously, the government \\nsuggests that this Court should consider issuing an order to show cause why \\ndisciplinary action should not be taken against respondent’s counsel “in light \\nof the extraordinary circumstances of this case.” . . . \\n[Eds.: The response to the ethics complaint:] \\n \\n  Finally, the government’s suggestion that this Court should consider \\nissuing an order to show cause why respondent’s counsel should not be \\ndisciplined provides no basis to find that counsel’s conduct presents grounds \\n53',\n",
       " 'for concern, much less sanction. The petition does not present legal or factual \\ngrounds for its suggestion that respondent’s counsel may have violated any \\napplicable rule of professional conduct. To the contrary, the government’s \\nrecitation of events shows that it failed to seek a stay from thi s Court in a \\ntimely manner based on assumptions it made about the timing of Ms. Doe’s \\nprocedure, not on the basis of any commitments from Ms. Doe’s lawyers. \\nCOUNTERSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \\nA. Facts \\nIn early September 2017, Jane Doe, a young woman of 17, enter ed the \\nUnited States without her parents. She was apprehended by U.S. authorities \\nand placed in HHS custody in a shelter run by a federal government grantee \\nin Texas. . . . A nationwide consent decree requires ORR and its shelters to \\nprovide “appropriate routine medical . . . care, family planning services, and \\nemergency health care services.”  \\nOn March 4, 2017, the Acting Director of ORR issued a letter informing \\ngrantees of its policy of “prohibit[ing] [shelters] from taking any action that \\nfacilitates an  abortion without direction and approval from the Director of \\nORR,” a policy that effectively gives the ORR Director veto power over a young \\nwoman’s abortion decision. \\nOnce in HHS custody, Ms. Doe was given a medical examination and \\ntold that she was pregn ant. She informed her custodians that she wished to \\nterminate the pregnancy. ORR directed the shelter to inform Ms. Doe’s mother \\nof her pregnancy over Ms. Doe’s objection. The government also required Ms. \\nDoe to attend a counseling session at an anti-abortion center.  \\nTo obtain an abortion under Texas law, a minor must obtain parental \\nconsent or a court order finding that she “is mature and sufficiently well \\ninformed to make the decision” on her own, or that “the notification and \\nattempt to obtain consent would not be in the best interest of the minor.” A \\nstate court appointed a guardian ad litem and an attorney ad litem for Ms. Doe \\nand, with their assistance, she received a court order on September 25 granting \\nher authority to consent to an abortion without the knowledge or consent of \\nher parents or legal guardian.  \\nUnder Texas law, Ms. Doe first had to attend counseling at least 24 \\nhours in advance of the abortion with the physician who would perform the \\nprocedure. When Ms. Doe requested permission to attend that counseling on \\nSeptember 27, ORR refused. \\nORR took this position notwithstanding contrary ICE and BOP policies \\nthat allow detained women to obtain abortions, and despite the government’s \\nposition in this case that Ms. Doe would have been free to have an abortion if \\nORR placed her with a sponsor. \\nB. Procedural History  \\n[For space purposes, we omit the procedural history as rehearsed by \\nthis brief; it was explained in the introduction above.]  \\nAt this point in time, the government could have immediately sought a \\n54',\n",
       " 'stay from this Court, just as it had immediately sought a stay from the court \\nof appeals when the district court entered the TRO. But it chose not to. \\nFollowing the D.C. Circuit’s decision, Ms. Doe’s guardian ad litem filed \\nan emergency motion to amend the TRO in the district court. The district court \\ngranted the motion shortly after 4 p.m. on October 24 and issued an amended \\nTRO that required the defendants to transport Ms. Doe, or allow her to be \\ntransported, “promptly and without delay, on such dates, including today, and \\nto such Texas abortion provider as shall be specified by [Ms. Doe’s] guardian \\nad litem or attorney ad litem, in order to obtain the counseling required by \\nstate law and to obtain the abortion procedure, in accordance with the abortion \\nproviders’ availability and any medical requirements.” Again, the government \\ncould have sought a stay from this Court at this point, but did not. \\n C. Post-TRO Events \\n  Upon receiving the amended TRO at about 4:15 p.m., Ms. Doe’s \\nguardian ad litem emailed shelter and Department of Justice (DOJ) personnel \\nrequesting that they transport Ms. Doe to the clinic. Despite the court order, \\nthe shelter responded that it would have to wait for ORR instructions. In \\nresponse, Ms. Doe’s attorney attached the court’s order and advised the shelter \\nthat she would initiate contempt proceedings if the government defied the \\norder.  \\nSoon thereafter, a DOJ attorney called Ms. Doe’s attorney to inform her \\nthat the shelter was transporting Ms. Doe. The DO J attorney explained that \\nthe shelter needed advance notice “of the timing of any appointments,” \\ngovernment counsel emailed Ms. Doe’s attorney to thank her for speaking \\nearlier and “to confirm [the attorney’s] understanding that the shelter had \\narranged fo r transport services this evening per your email.” Government \\ncounsel continued: “I would appreciate it if you could let me and [the Assistant \\nU.S. Attorney (AUSA) in Texas] know when the timing for tomorrow’s \\nprocedure is clarified.” Ms. Doe’s attorney replied minutes later stating that \\nshe appreciated the call, and that “[a]s soon as we understand the clinic’s \\nschedule tomorrow we will let you know.” \\nShortly after 6:00 p.m., shelter personnel emailed HHS and DOJ \\npersonnel that Ms. Doe’s attorney ad litem had informed them that “the \\nwindow for appointment this evening was missed,” and Ms. Doe should return \\nto the shelter.  \\n  At 6:17 p.m., Ms. Doe’s attorney emailed DOJ attorneys to say that the \\ndoctor was unable to stay that evening, and that “[t]he ad litems will arrange \\nwith the shelter to have [Ms. Doe] arrive at the clinic at 7:30 a.m.” the next \\nmorning. A few minutes later, Ms. Doe’s guardian informed shelter and DOJ \\npersonnel that Ms. Doe “has an appointment tomorrow morning at 7:30 a.m.” \\nat the clinic and “must be there on time.” The shelter confirmed that it would \\nmake “necessary arrangements to ensure minor is present.”  \\n  At 8:13 p.m., another DOJ attorney emailed Ms. Doe’s attorneys to say \\nthat DOJ intended to seek a stay from the Supreme Court the  next morning. \\nOne of Ms. Doe’s attorneys emailed back to thank the attorney for letting him \\n55',\n",
       " 'know. \\nAt 9:31 p.m., Ms. Doe’s guardian ad litem informed shelter and DOJ \\npersonnel that Ms. Doe’s “appointment has been moved to 4:15 a.m. at the \\naddress provided.” The shelter again confirmed receipt and indicated it had \\nmade transportation arrangements. Shelter personnel forwarded the email to \\nHHS personnel at 11:56 p.m. to inform them that it had “not received \\nconfirmation of what service will take place tomorrow , we were under the \\nimpression [Ms. Doe] was going in for mandated counseling, however, provided \\nnewly requested time was issued at the request of health center and attending \\nphysician, it is unclear whether [Ms. Doe] will partake in mandated counseling \\nor undergo medical procedure.”  \\n  At 4:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 25, shelter personnel emailed HHS \\npersonnel stating that the “health center charge nurse has confirmed that \\nminor is scheduled to undergo medical procedure this morning.” (emphasis \\nadded). \\nAfter 8 a.m. that morning, Ms. Doe’s abortion was performed by the \\ndoctor who had originally counseled her on October 19. In response to DOJ \\ninquiries, Ms. Doe’s attorney confirmed this fact in an email at 9:00 a.m.  \\n  Although the petition states that at the time Ms. Doe had her abortion \\nthe government “believed that it had identified a potentially suitable sponsor,” \\nand “believed that the process could be completed within a week,” it is now \\nmore than a month later, and the government still has not approved a sponsor; \\nMs. Doe remains in ORR custody. Had it not been for court intervention, Ms. \\nDoe would still be pregnant, against her will, today. \\nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \\n. . . \\n IV. THERE IS NO BASIS FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST \\nRESPONDENT’S COUNSEL. \\nThe government’s concluding suggestion that this Court “may wish to \\nissue an order to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken” \\nagainst respondent’s counsel, Pet. 26, is both extraordinary and baseless. It \\nfinds no support in the facts or the law. \\n  The government’s recitation of events shows that: (1) Ms. Doe’s counsel \\nmade a series of accurate statements concerning the availability of, and \\nlogistics surrounding, Ms. Doe’s ability to obtain an abortion; (2) some \\ngovernment personnel may have incorrectly assumed that Ms. Doe could not \\nobtain an abortion before October 26, even though she was legally entitled to \\nobtain an immediate abortion, and had received state-mandated counseling on \\nOctober 19; (3) some government lawye rs may have believed that Ms. Doe’s \\ncounsel would advise them if facts changed; and (4) Ms. Doe’s counsel did not \\ntake affirmative steps to notify the government that the doctor who provided \\nthe counseling on October 19 agreed to come back to the clinic. The \\ngovernment’s suggestion that this might amount to sanctionable misconduct is \\n56',\n",
       " 'not supported by legal authorities regarding attorney conduct, is not remotely \\njustified by the disciplinary cases it cites, and is contrary to counsel’s respective \\nethical duties. \\n  In an effort to show otherwise, the government repeatedly claims that \\nopposing counsel “represented” “that no abortion would take place until \\nOctober 26.” Yet no such representation appears in the emails or the \\ndeclaration of the AUSA lodged with th e Court by the Solicitor General that \\nthe government cites. Instead, the events recited in the petition indicate that \\nMs. Doe’s representatives stated at various times on October 24 that the \\nphysician who was available at the clinic on October 24 (who was not the \\nphysician who originally provided the state -mandated counseling) could \\nprovide a new counseling session, which would trigger a 24 -hour waiting \\nperiod. The government does not claim that any of these statements was false. \\n  The government also point s to statements that respondent’s counsel \\nmade to the district court on October 24. The petition states that respondent’s \\ncounsel represented to the court “that for Ms. Doe to obtain an abortion, she \\nwould need to complete a two -step, 24-hour process.” But this misrepresents \\ncounsel’s filing. Counsel requested an amendment to the original TRO to make \\nclear that its relief and the government’s obligation to transport or allow Ms. \\nDoe to be transported should be effective that very day. In support of this \\nchange, counsel noted that “a qualified physician is available at the nearest \\nclinic today, and will be available to perform the procedure tomorrow.” The \\nmotion specifically noted that it sought to ensure that Ms. Doe could “obtain \\nthe abortion . . . without further delay and as may be required by Texas state \\nlaw and the availability of physicians.” (emphases added). The motion thereby \\nmade clear that the TRO should enable Ms. Doe to obtain an abortion at the \\nearliest time and from any available physician. \\n  As this motion underscores, Ms. Doe’s counsel did not represent that, \\nin making arrangements for her to see the physician who was at the clinic on \\nOctober 24, they were forswearing any effort to secure an appointment with \\nany other doctor who might be able  to provide the abortion. Indeed, the \\ngovernment knew— and by its own account acknowledged to Ms. Doe’s \\nrepresentative on October 24 — that the original doctor could perform the \\nprocedure without the need to repeat counseling. It also knew that Ms. Doe’s \\nrepresentatives were considering various logistical arrangements to ensure \\nthat a doctor would be available to provide her abortion. These facts show that \\nthe situation was fluid; Ms. Doe’s representatives were considering multiple \\nalternatives; and they were seeking to obtain Ms. Doe’s long-delayed abortion \\nas soon as possible. The government implies that it reasonably believed these \\nalternatives did not include any effort to return the original doctor to the \\nfacility, and claims that Ms. Doe’s attorney ad litem had stated that this doctor \\n“was not available,” But this suggestion rests on yet another misleading \\nparaphrase: According to the government’s own declaration, the attorney ad \\nlitem stated that the original doctor “was not available on October 24. ” \\n(emphasis added). The government does not claim that the statement actually \\nmade was inaccurate, or that it was a representation that Ms. Doe’s counsel \\nwould make no effort to have that doctor return to the facility on October 25. \\n57',\n",
       " 'The government also points to a telephone call and exchanges of emails \\non October 24 in an effort to suggest that respondent’s counsel provided \\nassurances that the government did not need to request a stay because the \\nabortion would not occur until October 26. Specifically, the government makes \\nmuch of an email exchange in which one of its lawyers said the attorney “would \\nappreciate it if [Ms. Doe’s counsel] could let me and [the AUSA] know when \\nthe timing for tomorrow’s procedure is clarified,” and Ms. Doe’s counsel stated \\nthat “[a]s soon as we understand the clinic’s schedule tomorrow we will let you \\nknow.”  \\n  The government takes this exchange entirely out of context. Less than \\nan hour earlier, the shelter had refused to transport Ms. Doe to the clinic until \\nit had ORR’s approval, and the government had been advised that opposing \\ncounsel would “initiate contempt proceedings” if Ms. Doe was not transported \\nto the clinic promptly. The government attorney called respondent’s counsel \\nshortly thereafter to explain that the shelter needed advance notice to arrange \\ntransportation, and to confirm that Ms. Doe was now being transported to the \\nclinic. The government attorney then sent the email that confirmed “[the \\nattorney’s] understanding that the shelter had arranged for transport services \\nthis evening per your email,” and included the attorney’s request for \\ninformation about the timing of “tomorrow’s procedure.”  \\n  In context, the email exchange merely documents the government’s \\ncompliance with its obligation under the TRO to provide transpor tation, its \\ncommitment to do so again the following day, and counsel’s agreement to let \\nthe government know when Ms. Doe needed to be at the clinic the next day to \\navoid any further problems with transportation. Critically, the government’s \\nemail does not mention any stay motion, let alone link the request to the timing \\nof such a filing. Nor does the government claim that its attorney mentioned \\nany stay application in the earlier call. It is now wishful thinking to argue that \\nthis exchange over transportation logistics reflects a mutual understanding \\nthat the government need not seek a stay because opposing counsel “had \\nrepresented to the government that . . .  no abortion would occur until the \\nmorning of October 26.”  \\n  The government’s claim is further beli ed by the email exchange the \\ngovernment points to from later in the evening of October 24. The government \\nasserts that, “[b]ased on the representations of counsel that no abortion would \\noccur until October 26,” it informed the Clerk’s Office and respondent’s counsel \\nthat it would seek a stay the morning of October 25. But by the government’s \\nown account, no communication about the timing of a motion for a stay \\noccurred until 8:13 p.m. the night of October 24 and, even then, the email the \\ngovernment sent informing respondent’s counsel that it would seek a stay in \\nthe morning says nothing about any such representations. Nor does it \\ncommunicate the government’s “understanding” about the timing of the \\nprocedure or seek confirmation that respondent’s counsel shared that \\nunderstanding, much less a commitment that her counsel would promptly \\nadvise the government of any changed circumstances. The response from one \\nof Ms. Doe’s lawyers likewise includes no such confirmation or commitment. \\nIndeed, one of her attorneys responded to the 8:13 p.m. email by expressing \\n58',\n",
       " 'relief that he would not have to check his email for any stay motion filed later \\nthat night. That email indicates that Ms. Doe’s attorneys had expected the \\ngovernment to seek a stay that night—an expectation wholly inconsistent with \\nthe government’s suggestion that there was a mutual understanding that filing \\nwas unnecessary because Ms. Doe’s counsel has represented that the abortion \\nwould not occur until October 26. \\n  The Solicitor General argues that these st atements and events of \\nOctober 24 led some government personnel to assume that Ms. Doe would not \\nbe able to obtain an abortion prior to October 26. But none of the statements \\nthe government cites was a representation, much less a commitment, “that no \\nabortion would take place until October 26.”  \\n  The petition describes a course of events where many different parties \\nwere communicating into the night as events unfolded rapidly. Particularly \\ngiven this fluid situation, and the government’s knowledge that Ms. Doe had \\nsought throughout the litigation to obtain an abortion as soon as possible, it is \\nstriking that government counsel, by the government’s own account, neither \\nrequested that Ms. Doe forbear from obtaining the procedure while the \\ngovernment sought a stay from this Court nor sought confirmation of \\ngovernment counsel’s “understanding” that no abortion would occur prior to \\nOctober 26. Absent such a commitment or confirmation, it was incumbent upon \\ngovernment counsel immediately to seek a stay. The govern ment cannot now \\nblame opposing counsel for its own failure either to act with its customary \\nalacrity or to take any protective steps. \\nIn short, Ms. Doe’s counsel had made clear that they were attempting \\nto help their client obtain the abortion as soon as p ossible; the government \\nknew Ms. Doe had already received counseling from the original doctor, so that \\nif that doctor became available, the abortion could take place immediately; and \\naccording to the government’s own recitation of events, it did not link i ts \\nrequest for information about the timing of Ms. Doe’s appointment on October \\n25 with any statement concerning the timing of a stay motion with this Court. \\n  To suggest that respondent’s counsel had a duty to forbear from \\neffectuating the TRO on October 25 under these facts would turn counsel’s \\nethical obligations on their head. The only reason Ms. Doe’s representatives \\nneeded to talk to government personnel at all was to tell them the timing of \\nMs. Doe’s appointment so that the government would not delay  Ms. Doe’s \\ntransportation to the clinic. If government counsel wished to ensure that they \\nwould have an opportunity to seek a stay before the abortion procedure, they \\ncould and should have requested such an assurance from respondent’s counsel \\nand, if they did not receive a sufficiently clear commitment, they could and \\nshould have immediately sought relief from this Court. They inexplicably \\nfailed to take these reasonable steps, and cannot now blame respondent’s \\ncounsel for the consequences of their own inaction. \\n  In addition to failing to supply a factual basis for its extraordinary \\nrequest, the government fails to supply a specific legal rationale or cite to any \\nlegal authority that supports its position. The petition vaguely refers to “what \\nappear to be m aterial misrepresentations and omissions” by respondent’s \\n59',\n",
       " 'counsel, a claim that, if true, would violate ethical rules. See ABA, Model Rules \\nof Professional Conduct R. 3.3 (2016) (prohibiting knowingly false statement of \\nfact to a tribunal); id. R. 4.1(a) (barring “a false statement of material fact or \\nlaw to a third person”); id. R. 4.1 cmt. 1 (misrepresentations). But the \\ngovernment identifies no misrepresentations and fails to explain how counsels’ \\nstatements and/or actions would have amounted  to false statements. The \\npetition says that respondent’s counsel “arguably” had an obligation to notify \\nthe government that Ms. Doe’s original physician had become available on the \\nmorning of October 25. Yet the petition cites to no rule of ethics, case l aw, or \\nother authority to support such an obligation. Indeed, no such obligation \\nexists— and for sensible reasons. A lawyer “generally has no affirmative duty \\nto inform an opposing party of relevant facts,” except “when disclosure is \\nnecessary to avoid assi sting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client.” ABA, \\nsupra, R. 4.1 & cmt. 1; see id. cmt. 3. A lawyer has an “obligation zealously to \\nprotect and pursue a client’s legitimate interests, within the bounds of the \\nlaw,” id. pmbl., and violates that duty “whe n he or she … fails to take the \\nnecessary steps to preserve the client’s interests,” or to maintain client \\nconfidentiality.6 The events the government recites show that Ms. Doe’s \\ncounsel acted in their client’s best interests, which is precisely what counsel \\nare supposed to do.

Respondent does not dispute that, after the lower courts ruled late in the \\nafternoon of Tuesday, October 24, Ms. Doe’s representatives told the \\ngovernment that Ms. Doe would receive counseling from a new doctor on the \\nmorning of October 25, with the abortion to follow on October 26; and that, in \\nreliance on those representations, the government informed re spondent’s \\ncounsel it would file a stay application the morning of October 25, rather than \\nlate at night on October 24. Respondent is noticeably silent on what happened \\nnext. She does not deny that, after the government’s notice, Ms. Doe’s \\nrepresentatives secured the services of the original doctor and changed the \\nnature of Ms. Doe’s appointment without telling the government. Nor does \\nrespondent deny that these actions were a deliberate effort to prevent this \\nCourt’s review. Respondent contends only that, as a legal matter, the conduct \\nshould carry no consequences, either with respect to vacating the court of \\nappeals’ judgment or disciplining her attorneys. That is incorrect. . . . \\n  \\n \\n6 [Footnote 18 in brief]: Far from requiring Ms. Doe’s counsel to apprise the government \\nof the details of Ms. Doe’s medical appointments, ethics rules would have precluded \\nthem from agreeing to do so if it would undermine her interests. . . . \\n60',\n",
       " 'Second, this Court historically has been its own judge of whether \\nconduct is “unbecoming a member of [its] Bar,” Sup. Ct. R. 8.2, and the conduct \\nhere speaks for itself. The Model Rules and ethical principles governing the \\nlegal profession, however, lead to the same conclusion. Ms. Doe’s \\nrepresentatives may have been free to s ay nothing about the timing of her \\nprocedure. But they could not make repeated representations to the \\ngovernment (and the courts) about that procedure’s timing, know that the \\ngovernment was relying on those statements, act to render the statements \\nfalse, and then say nothing to correct the falsehood. That is not conduct \\nbecoming members of the Bar of this Court. . . . \\n   \\n2. With respect to disciplinary action, respondent does not dispute any \\nof the key facts: (i) her counsel indicated to the government and the courts that \\nthe doctor available to Ms. Doe during the week of October 23 was not the \\ndoctor who had provided her prior counseling (and thus the new doctor would \\nhave to wait at least 24 hours after counseling to perform the abortion under \\nTexas law); (ii) Ms. Doe’s representatives expressly told the government that, \\nwhen she did not receive counseling from the new doctor on Tuesday, October \\n24, she would not be able to undergo an abortion until Thursday, October 26; \\n(iii) respondent’s counsel knew that the government was relying on those \\nrepresentations when it delayed seeking emergency relief from this Court \\novernight on October 24; (iv) sometime after the government provided notice \\nof its intent to file on  the morning of October 25, Ms. Doe’s representatives \\nsecured the services of the original doctor; and (v) they made no effort to correct \\ntheir earlier statements. \\n  \\nUnder Rule 8.2, this Court has the authority to “take any appropriate \\ndisciplinary action against any attorney who is admitted to practice before it \\nfor conduct unbecoming a member of the Bar.” That standard is not tied to any \\nState’s ethical code or the Model Rules. Rather, “‘conduct unbecoming a \\nmember of the bar’ is conduct contrary to professional standards that shows an \\nunfitness to discharge continuing obligations to clients or the courts, or conduct \\ninimical to the administration of justice.” If respondent’s counsel knowingly \\nallowed the government to rely on statements that either respondent’s counsel \\nor Ms. Doe’s ad litems deliberately rendered false, such conduct is fairly \\ndescribed as “inimical to the administration of justice.” \\n  \\nThe Model Rules lead to the same conclusion. Rule 4.1 provides that, \\n“[i]n the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly *** make \\na false statement of material fact or law to a third person,” Model Rules of \\nProf’l Conduct R. 4.1 (2017), and shall not, at any time, “engage in conduct \\ninvolving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation,” Model Rules of Prof’l \\nConduct R. 8.4(c) (2017). Although a lawyer “generally has no affirmative duty \\nto inform an opposing party of relevant facts,” misrepresentations can occur \\nthrough “omissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” \\nModel Rules of Prof’l Conduct R. 4.1 cmt. 1 (2017). Even when a lawyer makes \\na representation he reasonably believes is true when made, an “obligation to \\ndisclose *** ordinarily arises” if the lawyer subsequently discovers the \\nstatement to be false. Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers § 98 \\n61',\n",
       " 'cmt. d (1998). Respondent points to no legitimate reason why these basic \\nprinciples should not apply here. \\n  \\nRespondent contends the government should have obtained a “clear \\ncommitment” that Ms. Doe would not obtain an abortion procedure before the \\ngovernment sought a stay on the morning of October 25. Respondent’s \\ncontention both ignores critical facts and is legally irrelevant. First, \\ngovernment counsel asked to be kept informed of the timing of Ms. Doe’s \\nprocedure, and in context the response — “[a]s soon as we understand the \\nclinic’s schedule tomorrow we will let you know”— indicated that respondent’s \\ncounsel would keep the government informed as to the timing of the procedure, \\nnot some mundane fact like what hours the clinic would be open. Second, \\nrespondent does not dispute that Ms. Doe’s attorney ad litem told the \\ngovernment an abortion could not take place until October 26 — a  \\nrepresentation that could not have been clearer. Third, after the government \\ninformed respondent’s counsel of its intentions, one of respondent’s attorneys \\nexpressed relief that he would not need to “check [his] email at 2 a.m.,” \\nconfirming that he knew the government was relying on his co -counsel’s \\nrepresentations about the timing of th e abortion. Even in the absence of a \\n“direct inquiry” from opposing counsel, an attorney’s silence can be equivalent \\nto a misleading statement where it is “obvious that [the opposing party] [i]s \\nacting under a misapprehension,” 2 Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. et al., The Law of \\nLawyering § 40.04, at 40 -13 (2015) (Hazard); see id. § 40.03, at 40 -10, \\nparticularly where it is the attorney’s own conduct  that created the \\nmisimpression. \\n  \\nRespondent insists that her counsel had an obligation “zealously to \\nprotect and pursue [her] legitimate interests” and to maintain client \\nconfidentiality. But “Model Rule 4.1(a) is not qualified or ‘trumped’ by \\nreference to the confidentiality principle set forth in Rule 1.6.” Hazard § 40.03, \\nat 40-12; see id. § 40.03, at 40 -10 (The “view that confidentiality is absolute” is \\n“discredited,” “goes too far, and is contrary to *** the law of lawyering.”). To be \\nclear, the government is not arguing that respondent’s counsel had “a duty to \\nforbear from effectuating” the district court’s amend ed TRO as rapidly as \\npossible. Rather, they had a duty not to inform the government (and otherwise \\nlead the government to believe) that the court’s order could not be effectuated \\nbefore October 26; know that the government was relying on those \\nrepresentations; and then actively work to render those representations false \\nin order to prevent this Court’s review. \\n  \\nTo take an analogous example, consider if government counsel informed \\nopposing counsel that the unavailability of a particular drug would prevent the \\ngovernment from carrying out an execution until some future date, but after \\nlearning that the prisoner planned to file an emergency stay application, \\ngovernment counsel undertook extraordinary efforts to obtain the drug and to \\ncarry out the execution sooner without notice to opposing counsel. The conduct \\nwould be no more becoming a member of the Bar of this Court because the \\ngovernment’s statements to counsel were accurate when made; the \\ngovernment never “forsw[o]r[e]” a different course of action; and nothing \\n62',\n",
       " 'prevented counsel from extracting more explicit commitments rather than \\ntaking the government at its word. Members of the Bar of this Court, \\nparticularly in the context of emergency proceedings, often rely on— and  \\nshould be safe in relying on — the duty of counsel to update statements that \\nhave become materially false, let alone as a result of counsel’s own conduct. . . \\n. \\n \\n__________ \\n \\nRestatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \\n§ 98. Statements to a Nonclient \\n A lawyer communicating on behalf of a client with a \\nnonclient may not: \\n(1) knowingly make a false statement of matters of \\nfact or law to the nonclient, \\n(2) make other statements prohibited by law; or \\n(3) fail to make a disclosure of information required \\nby law. \\nComment: \\n d. Subsequently discovered falsity. A lawyer who has made a \\nrepresentation on behalf of a client reasonably believing it true when \\nmade may subsequently come to know of its falsity.

See Restatement Second, \\nAgency § 348, Comment c; Restatement Second, Contracts, § 161(a) \\n(nondisclosure as equivalent to assertion when person “knows that \\ndisclosure of the fact is necessary to prevent some previous assertion \\nfrom being a misrepresentation or from being fraudulent or material”). \\nDisclosure, being required by law (see § 637) is not prohibited by the \\ngeneral rule of confidentiality (see § 60). Disclosure should not exceed \\nwhat is required to comply with the disclosure obligation, for example \\nby indicating to recipients that they should not rely on the lawyer’s \\nstatement. . . . \\n e. Affirmative disclosure. In general, a lawyer has no legal duty to \\nmake an affirmative disclosure of fact or law when dealing with a \\nnonclient. Applicable statutes, regulations, or common-law rules may \\nrequire affirmative disclosure in some circumstances, for example \\n \\n7 Section 63 (“Using or Disclosing Information When Required by Law”) states: “A \\nlawyer may use or disclose confidential client information when required by law, \\nafter the lawyer takes reasonably appropriate steps to assert that the information is \\nprivileged or otherwise protected against disclosure.” \\n63',\n",

Although the facts as laid out in the briefs are convoluted and  \\nmay be confusing, the gist of the issue is this: until late in the evening \\nof October 24, both Jane Doe’s counsel and government counsel believed \\nthat at her October 25 appointment she would receive counseling, in \\nwhich case she could not proceed with the abortion until October 26. \\nThat night, her counsel learned that the physician who had previously \\ncounseled her was available to perform the procedure on the 25th. They \\npushed the time back from 7:30 to 4:15, and informed government \\ncounsel of the time change. But they did not inform government counsel \\nthat the purpose of the appointment had changed from counseling to the \\nabortion itself. The government claims that this omission is equivalent \\nto an affirmative false statement. Is the omission indeed equivalent to a \\nlie? \\n What is your intuitive answer?  \\n Construct the strongest argument you can think of for each side’s \\nposition on the ethics issues. In doing so, consider the following \\nquestions: \\n  \\n 2. Was the information about the changed purpose of the October \\n25 appointment a client confidence under Model Rule 1.6? If so, do any \\nof the exceptions to Rule 1.6 apply in this case? \\n 3. Consider the fifth full paragraph of the government’s reply brief \\n(beginning “The Model Rules lead to the same conclusion.”). There, the \\n64',\n",
       " 'government maintains that Jane Doe’s counsel’s omission violates \\nModel Rule 4.1(a). That rule states that in the course of representing a \\nclient, a lawyer “shall not knowingly make a false statement of material \\nfact or law to a third person.” Did Jane Doe’s counsel violate this rule? \\n Consider in this context Model Rule 4.1(b), which states that a \\nlawyer representing a client shall not knowingly:  \\nfail to disclose a material fact to a third person when \\ndisclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or \\nfraudulent act by a client, unless disclosure is prohibited \\nby Rule 1.6. \\nJane Doe was not committing a criminal or fraudulent act, because she \\nhad a right to terminate her pregnancy. So Rule 4.1(b) does not apply to \\nthe facts of the case. Does it nevertheless affect the interpretation of \\nRule 4.1(a), regarding whether a failure to disclose a material fact is \\nequivalent to lying about a material fact? What does it imply that clause \\n(b) specifically prohibits “failure to disclose a material fact” whereas \\nclause (a) does not? And what does it imply about clause (a) that clause \\n(b)’s obligation to disclose material facts has an exception when \\n“disclosure is prohibited by Rule 1.6”? \\n4. The same paragraph from the government’s reply brief cites \\nRestatement § 98. Section 98 prohibits failure to disclose a material fact \\nwhen disclosure is required by law. Is disclosure in the present case \\nrequired by law? What law requires it? \\n5. Comment d of the Restatement, cited in the Reply Brief, seems \\nto fit the facts of this case: Jane Doe’s counsel believed that her October \\n25 appointment was for counseling, but subsequently came to know that \\nthis was no longer true. The Comment states that in such cases: “An \\nobligation to disclose before consummation of the transaction ordinarily \\narises unless the lawyer takes other corrective action.” Does this \\nComment apply in this case? What would be the “transaction” it refers \\nto? Does § 98 apply in adversarial litigation, or only in business \\ntransactions? \\n 6. Were ORR and the government lawyers drawing out the \\nlitigation until it would be too late for Jane Doe to receive her abortion? \\nIn a paragraph omitted from the cert petition excerpt above, the SG \\ndenies that ORR was stalling: \\nAlthough ORR . . .  denied Ms. Doe’s request that ORR \\nfacilitate an abortion, it continued to look for other avenues \\nto accommodate her. . . . Indeed, at the time Ms. Doe \\nultimately underwent an abortion, the government \\nbelieved that it had identified a potentially suitable \\nsponsor, and it was assisting in compiling the materials for \\n65',\n",
       " 'that person’s application. At that time, the government \\nbelieved that the process could be completed within a week, \\nand it intended to so inform this Court in its stay \\napplication. \\nQuoting this paragraph, ACLU’s reply brief in opposition notes that a \\nmonth after these events, there was still no sponsor for Jane Doe.

       " 'Case Study 4:  \\nGuantánamo Defense Counsel \\n \\n This case study involves an unusually dramatic set of ethical \\ndilemmas in a very atypical setting: the US Military Commissions in \\nGuantánamo Bay, Cuba, set up to try accused terrorists. Some \\ndefendants face the death penalty. These include Al Qaeda members \\naccused of orchestrating the 9/11 attacks, as well as an earlier attack on \\na US destroyer, the USS Cole, which was docked in Yemen. A speedboat \\nfull of explosives approached the Cole at night, and the explosion killed \\n17 US Navy sailors and wounded 39. The man accused of masterminding \\nthe Cole bombing is a Saudi national named Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, \\nwho was captured in 2002. The legal ethics events in this case study \\ninvolve his defense. \\nIn brief, al-Nashiri’s civilian death-penalty lawyers attempted in \\n2017 to withdraw from the case, apparently because they believed that \\ngovernment spying had made it impossible for them to communicate \\nconfidentially with their client —“apparently,” because they are not \\npermitted to say exactly what provoked their withdrawal. However, the \\npresiding military judge refused to permit them to withdraw. The stand-\\noff between judge and lawyers escalated, with dramatic consequences \\nincluding the contempt conviction of a Marine Corps general, threats to \\nhave the defense lawyers arrested and forcibly brought to represent al-\\nNashiri, abatement of the proceedings, and—unexpectedly—ethics \\naccusations against the judge that resulted in a scathing rebuke from \\nthe D.C. Circuit. \\nThe ethics issues include: \\n• confidentiality \\n• client communication \\n• lawyer conflict of interest \\n• withdrawal \\n• judicial conflict of interest \\n \\nBackground: The Guantánamo Bay Military Commissions \\n67',\n",
       " 'The Guantánamo Bay Military Commissions (hereafter ‘GBMC’ \\nfor short) were created by the Military Commissions Act of 2003. After \\nthe Supreme Court declared them illegal in 2006, 1 the statute was \\namended to cure defects, and it was amended again in 2009. The \\nMilitary Commissions are not part of the US domestic criminal justice \\nsystem—where cases are tried in Article 3 courts—nor part of the \\nmilitary justice system of courts-martial, used for criminal cases \\ninvolving members of the armed forces. The GBMC are special-purpose \\ncourts. Military commissions have been used in the past; most famously, \\nthe assassins of President Abraham Lincoln were tried before a military \\ncommission. The GBMC are limited to trials of “alien unprivileged \\nenemy belligerents for violations of the law of war and other crimes” \\nspecified in the statute. 2 Trials are before a jury of active-duty service \\nmembers, and the prosecutors and judges are also active -duty service \\nmembers. The statute provides for rules of evidence and procedure that \\ndiffer in many respects from those of Article 3 courts, most notably in \\nheightened concern not to reveal classified information, especially \\ninformation about “sources and methods” of intelligence gathering. \\nOverseeing the Military Commissions is its so-called “convening \\nauthority,” who at the time of these events was Harvey Rishikof, an \\neminent national security law expert, law teacher, and law school dean. \\nDisputes such as the one detailed below are ruled on in the first instance \\nby the trial judge, and next by the convening authority. Issues \\nconcerning the law of the military commissions then go to the United \\nStates Court of Military Commissions Review (CMCR)—a specially-\\ncreated appeals court—and then to the federal courts . \\nDefense Counsel: The MCDO \\nThe Military Commissions Act also creates the Military \\nCommissions Defense Organization (MCDO, pronounced “McDough”)—\\nthe equivalent of the “public defender”  for GBMC defendants. \\nDefendants are assigned a JAG officer as “detailed” defense counsel, and \\ncan also have civilian co-counsel. By law, capital cases require defense \\ncounsel who “shall be learned in the law applicable to capital cases” —\\nlearned counsel for short, also referred to as “special defense counsel” \\n(SDC). All the learned counsel are civilians. The Chief Defense Counsel \\n(CDC) of the MCDO at the time of these events was Marine Corps \\nBrigadier General John Baker. The military judge in al-Nashiri’s case \\nwas Air Force Colonel Vance Spath. \\n \\n1 Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006). \\n2 10 U.S.C. §948b(a).  \\n68',\n",
       " 'Al-Nashiri’s military counsel at the time was Navy Lieutenant \\nAlaric Piette, a former Navy SEAL, who subsequently went to law school \\nand was at the time in his fifth year of practice as a JAG. Learned \\ncounsel were Richard Kammen, an Indiana lawyer, and two assistant \\ncounsel, Mary Spears and Rosa Eliades. At the time of these events, \\nKammen had devoted thousands of hours to Al-Nashiri’s case. \\nTo keep the personnel straight, here is the “cast” in the dramatic \\nevents in the case study: \\n Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, defendant, accused mastermind of the \\nCole bombing \\n Navy Lieutenant Alaric Piette, al-Nashiri’s detailed military \\ndefense counsel \\n Richard Kammen, “learned” counsel (special defense counsel o r \\nSDC) \\n Mary Spears, SDC, assisting Mr. Kammen \\n Rosa Eliades, SDC, assisting Mr. Kammen \\n Marine Brigadier General John Baker , Chief Defense Counsel \\n(CDC) \\n Air Force Colonel Vance Spath, military judge in al-Nashiri’s case \\n Harvey Rishikoff, convening authority \\nFor a variety of reasons, the GBMC trials have proceeded at a \\nglacial pace, and the cases of al-Nashiri and the 9/11 defendants are still \\nmired in pretrial proceedings, 18 years after their capture and more \\nthan a decade after indictment. In part, this reflects a two-year hiatus \\nafter Hamdan declared the earlier GBMC illegal; in part, it comes from \\nmany complicated and novel legal issues under litigation; and in part, \\nfrom a number of scandals described below. But the delay also comes \\nfrom ferocious discovery battles as defense counsel try to get evidence of \\nal-Nashiri’s (and other defendants’) mistreatment while in CIA custody, \\nand the government fights tenaciously to keep this information out of \\ndefense hands. \\nBackground: The Question of Torture \\n Between the time of his capture in 2002 and his transfer to \\nGuantánamo Bay in 2006, al-Nashiri was held in secret CIA prisons \\n69',\n",
       " '(known as “black sites”) in several countries. During that time, he was \\nsubjected to what the government calls “enhanced interrogation,” but is \\nusually described, simply, as torture. Al-Nashiri was slammed into \\nwalls, shut into a “close confinement box,” waterboarded, threatened \\nwith an electric drill, deprived of sleep and clothing, and kept for years \\nin miserable conditions of confinement (continuous white noise, long \\nperiods of continuous darkness, long periods of continuous light, long \\nperiods of total isolation, sleep disruption). \\nNo US court, including the GBMC, has yet ruled on whether what \\nwas done to al-Nashiri and other defendants satisfies the legal definition \\nof torture. 3 But in public statements during his presidency, Barack \\nObama labeled it “torture,” and Donald Trump apparently agrees, \\nhaving vowed during his presidential campaign that he would bring \\nback torture “in a heartbeat.” In this case study, we will use the word \\n“torture.”  \\n Unsurprisingly, the CIA resists efforts to have its “sources and \\nmethods” of interrogation debated in court—revelations of the torture \\nprogram created a national scandal. As recently as February 2020, \\ndefense counsel for the 9/11 defendants spotted a silver tablet on the \\nprosecution’s table. It turned out to be a direct link from the prosecution \\nto the CIA and other “original classification authorities,” approved by \\nthe judge, so that these agencies can instruct prosecutors in real time \\nwhen to halt the proceedings over concerns that “sources and methods” \\nmight be revealed.4 Intelligence concerns help explain a series of events \\nthat have dogged the GBMC and which set the context for the conflict \\nat the heart of this case study. \\nBackground: Interference with Defense Counsel \\nFor years, MCDO counsel have complained of severe government \\ninterference in the client -lawyer relationship, including reading their \\nclient-lawyer mail and bugging the client interview rooms. But there \\nhave been other interferences as well, dating back to 2011. For example, \\nFBI agents approached a MCDO employee and “turned” that employee \\ninto a mole who provided confidential and privileged defense documents \\nto the FBI. In 2015, the government-provided interpreter given to one \\ndefendant turned out to be the same individual who worked as an \\ninterpreter at a CIA “black site” where defendants were tortured. In \\n \\n3 It is codified in 18 U.S.C. §2340A.  \\n4 John Ryan, Due Process Violation Claimed Over CIA Electronic Presence in 9/11 \\nPretrial, LAWDRAGON, Feb. 20, 2020, http://www.lawdragon.com/2020/02/20/due-\\nprocess-violation-claimed-over-cia-electronic-presence-in-9-11-pretrial/. \\n70',\n",
       " 'another incident, a judge discovered that the CIA was secretly \\nmonitoring hearings in his courtroom and censuring the audio feed to \\nonlookers. \\nThe following excerpt from a judicial opinion by the Court of \\nMilitary Commissions Review describes the circumstances leading to \\nlearned counsel Kammen, Spears, and Eliades seeking “excusal,” \\nmeaning withdrawal from al-Nashiri’s case. (However, the CMCR sided \\nwith Judge Spath against the three lawyers, on the ground that there is \\nno evidence that the government misconduct prejudiced al-Nashiri’s \\ndefense in violation of the Fifth or Sixth Amendment.) \\nUnited States v. Al-Nashiri \\nCMCR 18-002 \\nOctober 11, 2018 \\nBURTON, CHIEF JUDGE \\n… \\nMr. Kammen requested excusal from representing Al-Nashiri, \\nand he cited a series of intrusions into the attorney -client relationship \\nfrom October 2011 (“Guards confiscate privileged legal materials from \\nthe accuseds’ cells, and JTF GTMO’s [Joint Task Force Guantánamo, \\nCuba] legal department reads counsels’ correspondence to their clients. \\nDefense counsel have no ability to independently investigate the extent \\nof the disclosure or whether intelligence agencies were involved.”) to \\nJune 2017 (“The government acknowledges having ‘unintentionally’ \\neavesdropped on attorney-client communications at Guantanamo.”). \\nAppellee did not present any evidence that the prosecutors involved in \\nthis case received access to communications to or from Al-Nashiri or his \\ncounsel. . . . \\nIn January 2012, the JTF-GTMO Staff Judge Advocate learned \\nthat microphones were hidden inside a smoke detector where defense \\ncounsel met with their clients. A military judge ordered the listening \\ndevices to be dismantled. There is no evidence that the microphones \\nwere ever used to monitor communications between Al-Nashiri and his \\ncounsel.  \\nAl-Nashiri alleged that the government accessed the attorney -\\nclient mail of detainees at Guantanamo. In February 2012, the military \\njudge ordered the establishment of a Privilege Review Team (PRT), \\nindependent from JTF-GTMO and the prosecution, to screen detainee \\n71',\n",
       " 'legal mail for prohibited contraband. Al-Nashiri did not present any \\nevidence that the PRT violated the military judge’s restrictions \\nprohibiting the PRT from communicating contents of detainee mail to \\nprosecutors.  \\nAl-Nashiri alleged that in 2013, during technical upgrades of \\nservers and other technology, DoD information technology (IT) \\npersonnel caused the loss of numerous defense files.  \\nAl-Nashiri objected to DoD IT personnel monitoring of computer \\nInternet searches. DoD IT personnel monitor all DoD computer systems \\nfor inappropriate use. DoD IT personnel also have access to all files \\nstored on DoD computers connected to DoD servers, including attorney-\\nclient communications. A DoD IT person checked a defense employee’s \\nfiles for improper materials.  \\nOn June 14, 2017, the CDC wrote his subordinate MCDO defense \\ncounsel and advised them he had recently received information that led \\nhim to believe that there was no guarantee of confidentiality for \\nattorney-client communications in the rooms that the JTF-GTMO and \\nthe Joint Detention Group provided for defense counsel to meet with \\ntheir clients. He cautioned counsel to “not conduct any attorney-client \\nmeetings at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba until they know with certainty that \\nimproper monitoring of such meetings is not occurring.”  \\nOn the same day, the CDC wrote further:  \\nOn 30 November 2016, the Military Judge in United \\nStates v. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed et al. ordered that \\nintrusive monitoring (i.e., listening and audio and video \\nrecording) of attorney-client meetings be formally \\nprohibited in the standard operating procedures for [JTF-\\nGTMO] and the [Joint Detention Group]. The Military \\nJudge further ordered that defense counsel must be \\nadvised in advance if a meeting with an accused is to be \\nmonitored. The Military Judge issued these orders because \\nhe recognized the legitimate concerns of defense attorneys \\nthat attorney-client meetings at GTMO were being \\nimproperly monitored by government personnel.  \\nAt present, I am not confident that the prohibition \\non improper monitoring of attorney -client meetings at \\nGTMO as ordered by the commission is being followed. My \\nloss of confidence extends to all potential attorney-client \\nmeeting locations at GTMO. Consequently, I have found it \\n72',\n",
       " 'necessary as part of my supervisory responsibilities under \\n9- 1a.2 and 9 -1a.9 of the Regulation for Trial by Military \\nCommission to make the above-described recommendation \\nto all MCDO defense counsel. Whether, and to what extent, \\ndefense teams follow this advice is up to the individual \\ndefense team.  \\nOn July 7, 2017, the military judge ruled that he did not have the \\nauthority to allow SDC to discuss classified information with Al-Nashiri, \\nwho had no security clearance. In doing so, the military judge noted, “the \\nGovernment, as officers of the court, have represented facts which \\naffirmatively negate what the Defense seeks to disclose to the Accused.” \\nEach of Al-Nashiri’s lawyers had a security clearance that required \\nthem not to disclose classified information to anyone who was not \\nauthorized to receive it.  \\nThe defense moved on July 13, 2017, to take discovery regarding \\npotential intrusion by the government into privileged communications. \\nOn September 20, 2017, the military judge denied Al-Nashiri’s request \\nfor discovery. After full briefing that included classified information, the \\nmilitary judge concluded that there was no “basis to find there had been \\nan intrusion into attorney-client communications” between Al-Nashiri \\nand his counsel.  \\nDespite the repeated urgings of the military judge, the \\ngovernment took several months to declassify the circumstances \\ninvolving the microphone or microphones found in April 2017 in the \\nroom in which defense  counsel and Al-Nashiri met. Most of the \\ninformation was release after the SDC ended their representation of Al-\\nNashiri. Some information about the intrusions relating to detainees \\nother than Al-Nashiri and the August 2017 inspection of a room in which \\nAl-Nashiri and his counsel previously met continues to be classified.  \\nIn August 2017, a defense inspection of the room allocated for \\nmeetings between Al-Nashiri and his counsel revealed a microphone or \\nmicrophones that were not connected to recording or transmission \\nequipment. The government referred to the devices as “legacy” \\nmicrophones left over from before 2012 when the building was \\nconfigured for detainee interviews. Thus, Al-Nashiri’s meeting room was \\nequipped with recording equipment. However, the government \\nrepresented to the military judge that when Al-Nashiri met with his \\nSDC, the room included disconnected, legacy microphones that were not \\nconnected to any audio listening/recording device. While it was apparent \\nthat this room serving as the new meeting location had been previously \\n73',\n",
       " 'configured for interviews, no audio equipment was used while Mr. al \\nNashiri was in the room.  \\nAs the events unfolded during the summer of 2017, Mr. Kammen \\nsought an opinion from Ellen Yaroshefsky, an ethicist and professor at \\nHofstra University’s School of Law in New York  regarding his ethical \\nobligations to continue to represent Al-Nashiri in light of SDC’s \\nconcerns. As understood by Professor Yaroshefsky, Mr. Kammen was \\nconcerned that (1) the government had intruded into SDC’s privileged \\ncommunications with Al-Nashiri, and (2) SDC lacked confidence that \\nthey could securely communicate with their client, and because of this \\nlack of confidence, SDC were unable to inform Al-Nashiri of these \\nmatters and discuss their concerns with him.  \\nIn addition to the dispute involving “legacy” microphone(s) in the \\nmeeting room where Al-Nashiri met with his counsel, the bases of SDC’s \\nconcerns over the security of their privileged communications with Al -\\nNashiri included a series of events that occurre d between 2008 and \\n2017. Among these events were intrusions or alleged intrusions by the \\ngovernment into the privileged communications of detainees and \\ndefendants at JTF-GTMO. Mr. Kammen summarized the SDC \\ncontentions regarding these matters in a document titled, \\n“Governmental Interference with Attorney-Client Communications, \\nIntrusions into Attorney-Client Relationships, Undisclosed Monitoring, \\nand Infiltration of Defense Teams” (Defense Intrusion Allegations).5  \\n__________ \\nThe Events \\nAfter they found a “legacy” microphone in the interview room, the \\ndefense asked for discovery on the issue; Judge Spath denied the \\nrequest, finding that al-Nashiri’s confidentiality concerns extended only \\nto attorney-client conversations used by the prosecution against him. He \\nalso denied their request for a hearing on the issue, and, finally, he \\ndenied counsels’ request to be able to inform al-Nashiri about their \\nprivacy concerns. Interestingly, in its responses to these motions, the \\ngovernment acknowledged that the room had more microphones than \\nthe one counsel discovered. \\n \\n5 In a 2018 speech to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, General \\nBaker provides further details about these intrusions.

       " 'The three civilian learned counsel concluded that , under these \\ncircumstances, they could not continue to represent their client. \\nThe Chief Defense Counsel, General Baker, agreed with \\nKammen, Spears, and Eliadis and excused them from the case.  \\nAll this resulted in drama: Judge Spath told General Baker that \\nhe, not the CDC, must approve excusals. He pointed to a provision in \\nthe Trial Judiciary Rules of Court indicating that excusal requires \\njudicial approval—and that he did not approve the excusal. He ordered \\nthe three SDC back to Guantánamo. But they did not show up to board \\nthe airplane. \\nGeneral Baker stood by his decision. He pointed to a rule in the \\nManual for Military Commissions stating that “an authority competent \\nto detail such counsel may excuse or change such counsel”—and that he, \\nas CDC, is the authority competent to detail defense counsel. Judge \\nSpath disagreed, because the Trial Judiciary Rules of Court —a bench \\nbook for GBMC judges—is inconsistent with the Manual for Military \\nCommissions, and gives the judge final authority over excusal.6 \\nJudge Spath found General Baker in contempt of court, and \\nsentenced him to 21 days of confinement to quarters. This would likely \\nbe a career-ender for General Baker. Baker appealed to the convening \\nauthority, who upheld the contempt conviction but reversed the \\nsentence.7 General Baker next appealed to the U.S. District Court in the \\nDistrict of Columbia for a writ of habeas corpus, on the ground that the \\njudge has no contempt authority in this case. Months later, the court \\nagreed and reversed General Baker’s contempt conviction. 8 While \\nBaker’s appeal was pending, Secretary of Defense James Mattis fired \\nthe convening authority who had ratified the contempt conviction, \\nreportedly because of his efforts to explore possible plea bargains in \\nthese long-stalled cases. \\nMeanwhile, the three learned counsel refused to  continue the \\ncase.

This repeatedly \\ndrew the judge’s ire, but Lieutenant Piette remained firm. The judge \\naccused the defense team of deliberate stalling tactics.

The court pointed to the Rules of \\nProfessional Conduct in Illinois and Indiana, the states in which the \\nthree learned counsel are licensed. Like the Model Rules, their Rule 1.16 \\nstates: \\n(c) A lawyer must comply with applicable law requiring \\nnotice to or permission of a tribunal when terminating a \\nrepresentation. When ordered to do so by a tribunal, a \\nlawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good \\ncause for terminating the representation.  \\n(d) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take \\nsteps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a \\nclient’s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the \\nclient, [and] allowing time for employment of other counsel \\n. . . .  \\n \\n11 Carol Rosenberg, Frustrated judge halts Guantánamo’s USS Cole war crimes trial, \\nMIAMI HERALD, Feb. 16, 2018, available at http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-\\nworld/world/americas/guantanamo/article200496069.html . \\n12 Id. \\n77',\n",
       " 'The court also found that, until learned counsel could be found , Al-\\nNashiri’s trial could nevertheless proceed; and that there was no good \\ncause for Nashiri’s counsel to excuse themselves.  \\nThe government made an unequivocal representation to \\nthe military judge that it did not intrude into Al-Nashiri’s \\nprivileged communications with his attorneys. The \\nmilitary judge stated, “[N]o evidence has yet been presented \\nto demonstrate intrusions in this case affecting this \\naccused which would ethically require withdrawal or \\ndisqualification of outside appointed learned counsel.” \\nMoreover, even if there was evidence of an intrusion into \\nAl-Nashiri’s attorney-client relationship, there also must \\nbe evidence of prejudice before relief may be granted.  \\nBefore considering the issue of prejudice, however, there \\nmust first be evidence of an intrusion into the relationship \\nbetween Al-Nashiri and his counsel. No such evidence has \\nbeen presented to-date. We have no evidence the \\nprosecution received or attempted to receive any of Al-\\nNashiri’s attorney-client strategy or communications. Of \\ncourse, the door is not closed to Al-Nashiri on this issue. If \\nhis defense counsel obtain and present such evidence, the \\nmilitary judge should make findings and consider an \\nappropriate remedy.13 \\nThis decision was not the final act of the drama, which took an \\nunexpected turn. But, at this point, it is time to raise some ethical \\nquestions. Did defense counsel do the right thing by excusing \\nthemselves?  \\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS \\n 1.  Given the extensive history of intrusions, can defense counsel \\nhave any confidence that their conversations with their clients are \\nconfidential? If not, can they ethically represent their clients? \\nNote that Judge Spath denied defense motions for discovery on \\nthe extent of intrusions on confidentiality, and the CMCR mentioned \\nrepeatedly that there was no evidence that the prosecution had access \\nto attorney-client confidences. Without discovery, how could the defense \\nfind such evidence? Judge Spath took the prosecution’s word. He also \\nheld that al-Nashiri’s confidentiality interest extends only to attorney-\\n \\n13 United States v. Al-Nashiri, CMCR 18-002, Oct. 11, 2018, slip op. at 31. \\n78',\n",
       " 'client privileged information used by the prosecution against him. Is this \\na correct understanding of confidentiality? \\n 2.  Under Rule 1.6, Al-Nashiri can waive the right of \\nconfidentiality if he gives informed consent. Richard Kammen states \\nthat, because information about the intrusions is classified, he cannot \\nexplain to Al-Nashiri the basis for his concerns about bugging, and that \\ninformed consent is impossible. If so, can Kammen or other defense \\ncounsel fulfill their obligation of client communication under Rule 1.4? \\n 3.  In the CMCR decision excerpted above, the court states that, \\n“even if there was evidence of an intrusion into Al-Nashiri’s attorney-\\nclient relationship, there also must be evidence of prejudice before relief \\nmay be granted.” The decision cites Fifth and Sixth Amendment cases \\non ineffective assistance of counsel, which do not grant reversal if the \\ndefense was not prejudiced. Is this the correct standard for determining \\nwhether counsel can ethically proceed with a representation?  In other \\nwords: is the constitutional standard the same as the ethical standard? \\n 4.  After Judge Spath ordered Al-Nashiri’s counsel to proceed with \\nthe defense, under threat of contempt of court, was there a conflict of \\ninterest for the lawyers? Under Rule 1.7(a)(2), “a concurrent conflict of \\ninterest exists if there is significant risk that the representation of one \\nor more clients will be materially limited . . . by a personal interest of \\nthe lawyer.” Concurrent representations are prohibited. Will lawyer s \\njudicially coerced into representing a death penalty client be materially \\nlimited by their own personal interest in avoiding punishment ? Judge \\nSpath threatened to have Kammen, Spears, and Eliades arrested. Were \\nthey in a position to stand up to the judge when necessary? \\nClause (b)(1) of Rule 1.7 states that, “notwithstanding the \\nexistence of a concurrent conflict of interest under paragraph (a), a \\nlawyer may represent a client if [among other conditions] the lawyer \\nreasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent \\nand diligent representation to each affected client.” Was that condition \\nfulfilled here? \\n5.  Suppose that substitute counsel were recruited. Could they \\ntake the case under Rule 8.4(a)? \\n6.  Did the learned counsel and Lieutenant Piette have “good \\ncause” for excusal? Did they do the right thing? \\n7.  Judge Spath accused the lawyers of deliberately stalling the \\nslow-moving case. Suppose the lawyers believe that their client is likely \\nto be convicted and sentenced to death. (We do not know this, and many \\n79',\n",
       " 'observers believe that the court will not impose the death penalty on a \\ndefendant who was tortured by the government.) If it is in the client’s \\ninterest to delay the trial and verdict, may defense counsel do that? \\nMust they do that? Consult Rule 3.2 (“Expediting Litigation”) and its \\ncomment. (This rule is substantially identical to the rule covering \\nLieutenant Piette.14) \\n \\nThe Denouement \\n The confrontation between Judge Spath and al-Nashiri’s defense \\nteam came to a surprise ending when unexpected information emerged. \\nAs an opinion of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals explains: \\nAir Force Colonel Vance Spath began presiding over Al-\\nNashiri’s commission in July 2014. But just over a year into \\nhis assignment to the case, he applied for a job with the \\nDepartment of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration \\nReview. Spath, however, never disclosed the fact of his \\napplication, much less its details, to Al-Nashiri or to his \\ndefense team. Instead, records obtained through a \\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) request—documents \\nwhose authenticity the government does not dispute—\\nreveal the information we now possess about Spath’s job \\nsearch. . . . \\nSpath submitted his application to an open \\nimmigration judge position in the Executive Office for \\nImmigration Review on November 19, 2015. In his \\napplication, Spath highlighted his “five years of experience \\nas a trial judge,” including that he had been “handpicked” \\nto preside over “the military commissions proceedings for \\nthe alleged ‘Cole bombing’ mastermind”—that is, Al-\\nNashiri—“at Guantanamo Bay.” He also included as a \\nwriting sample an order he issued in Al-Nashiri’s case.15 \\nJudge Spath was notified in 2017 that his application had been accepted, \\nbut a negotiation ensued over the start date. The negotiation continued \\nduring his confrontation with defense counsel. The Court continues: \\n \\n14 Dep’t. of the Navy, JAG Instruction 5803.1E, Rule 3.2, \\nhttps://www.jag.navy.mil/library/instructions/JAGINST_5803-1E.pdf . \\n15 In re Al-Nashiri, 921 F.3d 224, 227 (D.C.C. 2019). \\n80',\n",
       " 'The two subplots of Spath’s story—the judge’s employment \\nnegotiations with the Executive Office for Immigration \\nReview and his standoff with Al-Nashiri’s defense \\ncounsel—reached their denouement the week of February \\n12, 2018. On Monday, Spath orally denied Spears’s and \\nEliades’s motions to quash, leaving in place the subpoenas \\nrequiring their appearance via videoconference the \\nfollowing day. But when, on Tuesday morning, Spears and \\nEliades informed the government that they would not \\nappear, Spath directed the government to draft writs of \\nattachment for their arrest so that, as he put it, he would \\nhave “options available . . . when we get here tomorrow.” \\nSpath, however, made no decisions on Wednesday or \\nThursday. Instead, he explained that he was “still trying to \\nfigure out what to do,” and that he would “think about this \\novernight.”16 \\nThis was Judge Spath’s sleepless night when he walked on the treadmill \\n“to calm me down” while deciding to abate the proceedings. The Court \\ncontinues: \\nBut Spath apparently was mulling a different important \\ndecision on Thursday night. Earlier that day, he had \\nreceived an email from a human resources specialist in the \\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review informing him \\nthat he was “able to [start] with [the] agency . . . on July 8, \\n2018.” “When you have returned to the [S]tates,” she wrote, \\n“please let me know so we can arrange a time to call you \\nand go over the Immigration Judge appointment \\ninformation. “Thank you,” Spath replied. “I get back over \\nthe weekend. I will give you a call on Tuesday.”  \\nThe following morning, Spath abated “indefinitely” \\nthe commission proceedings against Al-Nashiri. Declaring \\nthat “[o]ver the last five months . . . [his] frustration with \\nthe defense [had] been apparent,” Spath concluded that \\n“[w]e need action from somebody other than me” or else \\n“[w]e’re going to continue to spin our wheels and go \\nnowhere.” He added, “[I]t might be time for me to retire, \\nfrankly. That decision I’ll be making over the next week or \\ntwo.”17 \\n \\n16 Id. at 230. \\n17 Id. \\n81',\n",
       " 'Judge Spath stepped down from the GBMC, retired from the Air Force, \\nand took up his job as an immigration judge in Arlington, Virginia, \\nwhere he currently serves (as of July 2020). \\nDuring the summer of 2018, al-Nashiri’s defense team received “ \\n‘credible reports’ that Spath had been pursuing appointment as an \\nimmigration judge.”18 This resulted in a defense appeal to the CMCR \\nseeking discovery on the matter and requesting vacatur of Spath’s prior \\nrulings. The CMCR denied the motion, and counsel appealed to the D.C. \\nCircuit Court of Appeals. \\nThe Court of Appeals reversed the CMCR and vacated all 460 of \\nJudge Spath’s orders issued during the two-plus years he had been \\nnegotiating for the IJ position. 19 That includes his orders to the three \\nlearned counsel and his order to proceed in the absence of learned \\ncounsel. \\nExplaining why the judge’s conduct created a conflict of interest \\ncalling for such a drastic remedy, the Court of Appeals noted that “the \\nAttorney General himself is directly involved in selecting and \\nsupervising immigration judges,” and the Attorney General \\nsimultaneously “was a participant in Al-Nashiri’s case from start to \\nfinish.”20 Both judicial and lawyer ethics prohibit judges from \\nnegotiating for a job with a party before their court, because it creates \\nthe appearance of partiality. 21 In this case, the judge had a financial \\nstake, because the immigration judge position would give him a salary \\nover and above his military pension. \\nAstonishingly, the military judge who replaced Judge Spath was \\nalso negotiating for a post-retirement immigration judgeship. Upon \\nrevelation of that fact, she was swiftly removed from the case.22  \\n \\n \\n18 Id. at 231. \\n19 Id. at 238, 240. \\n20 Id. at 235–36. \\n21 RULE 1.12(b); Scott v.

      "\n",
      "Rita's Case, as presented in the provided excerpts, details the legal and social service involvement surrounding Rita, a young girl with a troubled family history.  Born to a heroin-addicted mother, Rita spent her early years in the care of her maternal grandmother, Gladys. Gladys, facing challenges in managing Rita's increasingly aggressive and difficult behavior, repeatedly sought assistance from the Department of Public Welfare (DPW).\n",
      "\n",
      "The DPW's interventions involved placing Rita in the Catholic Home for Children, initially as a therapeutic placement. However, the Home, often used as a clearinghouse for foster care, eventually attempted to place Rita with a foster family.  This placement was unsuccessful due to strained relations between Gladys and the foster parents, leading to Rita's return to her grandmother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subsequent difficulties led to another DPW intervention and Rita's return to the Catholic Home.  Concerns arose about Rita's apparent sexual sophistication, suggesting possible sexual abuse. This accelerated efforts to place Rita in a foster home.  The case highlights the interplay between legal aid lawyers, social workers, physicians, and the DPW, illustrating the complexities of navigating the child welfare system and the ethical dilemmas faced by professionals involved in such cases.  The excerpts raise questions regarding the adequacy of legal representation for all parties, and the effectiveness of available legal and social welfare alternatives in addressing Rita's complex situation.  The case study focuses on the ethical considerations for the lawyers involved, particularly in relation to their advocacy for Gladys and Rita, and the potential impact of their actions on the overall outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:** The provided text lacks specific legal rulings or court decisions.  Therefore, a traditional legal analysis based on holdings and ratio decidendi is not possible. The excerpts present a factual account used for ethical analysis in legal education. The ethical questions raised focus on the roles of the lawyers, social workers, and the DPW, and the effectiveness of the system in protecting Rita's best interests.\n"
